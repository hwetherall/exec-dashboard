## Overview

Novaworks is building an AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) platform on ServiceNow to solve the inefficiency of legacy systems for the deskless workforce. This memo informs a decision to make a $1M strategic seed investment, and we recommend proceeding due to the venture's exceptional alignment with ServiceNow's strategy to extend the Now Platform into a core system of record and directly challenge incumbents like Workday.

## Strategic Opportunity Fit

Strategic Opportunity Fit – Strong fit. This venture directly supports ServiceNow's corporate strategy by creating a native, AI-driven HCM system of record on the Now Platform, leveraging our brand, go-to-market channels, and data fabric to displace competitors from within our own customer base.

## Execution Roadmap

The investment thesis requires Novaworks to successfully build its MVP on an aggressive timeline and convert its "customer zero" partners, including ServiceNow, into paid pilots that validate both the technology and the premium pricing model. The primary execution risks are the significant challenge of building a complex enterprise product from a standstill and the critical dependency on formalizing the co-sell and IP licensing partnership with ServiceNow, which is currently based on verbal agreements.

## Venture Opportunity Snapshot

The large Human Capital Management market is primed for AI-led disruption, especially for the historically underserved deskless workforce segment. Novaworks' approach of building an AI-native solution directly on the Now Platform creates a unique opportunity to displace competitors like Workday by offering a more integrated, modern, and cost-effective alternative to our shared enterprise customers.

---

## Analysis

**Team & Execution:** **Exceptional founder-market fit, but key-person risk is high.** The founding team combines prior entrepreneurial exits with deep ServiceNow experience, providing unique credibility and an ability to navigate our ecosystem. However, execution capability is dangerously concentrated in the three founders, and the critical Chief Data & AI Officer role remains unfilled, posing a risk to its "AI-native" promise.

**Market (TAM) & Trends:** **Large, validated market with strong AI tailwinds.** The $34.1B HCM market is rapidly adopting AI, creating a clear window of opportunity for a challenger. The venture's focus on the underserved deskless workforce provides a strategic entry point, though its claimed $12B serviceable market is an unverified company estimate that requires further validation.

**Technology & Solution:** **Strong vision, but pre-product with IP risks.** The AI-native, agentic architecture built on ServiceNow is a compelling technical differentiator that aligns perfectly with our platform strategy. However, the company is pre-product with no existing IP, and its reliance on a verbal agreement for ServiceNow's "Skills Intelligence" IP—which includes a grant-back clause—is a significant legal risk that we must help formalize and de-risk.

**Traction & Validation:** **Zero traction; validation depends entirely on unverified partner commitments.** As a pre-product company, there is no revenue or customer validation. The entire investment thesis rests on converting claimed "customer zero" commitments from ServiceNow and Bell Canada into paid pilots, which is the most critical near-term milestone to de-risk the opportunity.

**Terms, Finance & Operations:** **Unrealistic financial model and a tight runway.** The financial projections, particularly the 105.7x LTV/CAC ratio and a 2.3-month payback period, are not credible and rely on unproven channel efficiencies. The requested $7M seed round provides a tight 15-month runway with little buffer for delays, and the model contains internal inconsistencies regarding headcount and gross margins that must be reconciled.

## Critical Open Questions

- How formal are the "customer zero" commitments from ServiceNow's internal business units and Bell Canada, and what is their true willingness to pay for a pilot at a material price point?
- Can the verbal agreement for ServiceNow's "Skills Intelligence" IP be formalized into a written license with terms that provide Novaworks with sufficient freedom to operate and build value without encumbering its future IP?
- Is the proposed $7M seed round sufficient to reach meaningful validation milestones (i.e., multiple paid pilots) given the 6-9 month enterprise sales cycle and significant product development required from a standing start?
- What is a realistic, bottoms-up financial model for customer acquisition cost and gross margin, and does the business remain viable under more conservative, industry-benchmarked assumptions?
- Who is in the pipeline for the critical Chief Data & AI Officer role, and can this position be filled quickly to guide the core product build and validate the "AI-native" thesis?



# Executive Summary - 10 Pager

## Overview

Novaworks presents a high-risk, high-reward strategic investment opportunity for ServiceNow. The venture aims to build an AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) platform directly on the Now Platform, targeting the large, underserved deskless workforce to compete with incumbents like Workday. The founding team, which includes former ServiceNow executives, provides exceptional strategic alignment and insider knowledge. However, the company is pre-product and pre-revenue, facing significant execution, financial, and legal risks. The core investment thesis is contingent on validating unverified customer commitments and formalizing a critical but currently verbal partnership with ServiceNow. The recommendation is to proceed with focused diligence to address these fundamental uncertainties before committing capital.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Exceptional Strategic Fit**: Novaworks' mission to build a native HCM on the Now Platform directly supports ServiceNow's strategy to become a system of record and displace competitors like Workday from within its own customer base.
*   **Experienced Founding Team**: The team, led by a former ServiceNow executive, possesses deep domain expertise, prior entrepreneurial success, and invaluable insider knowledge of the ServiceNow ecosystem.
*   **Large Market Opportunity**: The venture targets the large and growing $34.1B HCM market, with a strategic focus on the underserved deskless workforce and the market-wide shift to AI-driven solutions.
*   **Unproven Execution Plan**: The company is pre-product and pre-revenue, with an aggressive development timeline, an unreliable financial model containing internal inconsistencies, and a critical leadership gap for the Chief Data & AI Officer role.
*   **Critical External Dependencies**: Success is entirely contingent on formalizing a verbal IP and co-sell agreement with ServiceNow and validating unconfirmed "customer zero" commitments, which currently lack evidence of a true willingness to pay.

## Risks

*   **Execution Risk**: The venture is pre-product and must build a complex enterprise solution from a standstill on an aggressive 15-month timeline with a tight budget and a key leadership gap in the Chief Data & AI Officer role.
*   **Financial Viability Risk**: The financial model is not credible, with unrealistic unit economics (105.7x LTV/CAC), internal inconsistencies on headcount, and an insufficient 15-month runway that leaves no margin for common enterprise sales cycle or product development delays.
*   **Partnership & IP Risk**: The entire business model depends on a verbal agreement with ServiceNow for IP licensing and go-to-market support. The IP agreement includes a grant-back clause that could encumber Novaworks' future value and must be formalized.
*   **Market Validation Risk**: There is no revenue or product validation. The investment thesis rests on unverified "customer zero" commitments from ServiceNow and Bell Canada, with no evidence of their willingness to pay a premium price for a pilot.

## Next Steps

*   **Validate Customer Commitments**: Secure formal, written, paid pilot agreements from at least two of the three "customer zero" partners to confirm market demand and willingness-to-pay at a material price point.
*   **Formalize ServiceNow Partnership**: Execute a definitive written agreement for the IP license (clarifying the grant-back clause) and the co-sell partnership within 90 days of investment.
*   **Rebuild Financial Model**: Develop a credible, bottoms-up 24-month operating budget and financial model that reconciles the hiring plan with expenses and demonstrates sufficient runway.
*   **Secure AI Leadership**: Fill the vacant Chief Data & AI Officer role to provide the necessary technical leadership to guide the product build and de-risk the "AI-native" thesis.

## Tell it to me straight
> Let's be clear. This isn't an investment in a company; it's a $1M call option on owning the native HCM for our platform. The real asset here is Kelley Steven-Waiss. She's one of us—a former ServiceNow exec and a CHRO who knows the platform, the buyers, and the problem inside and out. She's assembled a team with prior exits to build an HCM on our turf specifically to go after Workday's customers within our own accounts. Strategically, it's a perfect fit.
>
> But right now, it's all just a story. They're pre-product, pre-revenue, and have zero IP. The financial model is a joke—100x LTV/CAC is fantasy. The whole thing hinges on two questions: can they actually build this complex product on a shoestring budget, and can they turn their verbal handshakes with us and Bell Canada into real, paying contracts?
>
> The biggest landmine is the legal mess with our own IP. They have a "verbal agreement" with a grant-back clause that could give us a headache later. We need to get that in writing and de-fanged before we wire a dime. This is an outsourced R&D project with a world-class team that could become a massive strategic asset or a quick acqui-hire. Our job is to lock down the IP terms and force them to prove someone will actually pay for this thing.

### Should We Do It? (Strategic Attractiveness & Fit)

**Strategic Attractiveness of the Prize:** The opportunity is large, durable, and strategically vital. Novaworks targets the $34.1 billion Human Capital Management (HCM) market, which is projected to grow at a 9.6% compound annual growth rate [DOC: Novaworks_TAM_SAM.pptx, p. 1], [Fortune Business Insights](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/human-capital-management-hcm-market-100240). The venture focuses on two high-priority segments: the historically underserved deskless workforce, which comprises 80% of global employees, and the market-wide shift toward AI-native solutions [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. With AI in HR being the top emerging technology priority for HR leaders, the timing is opportune to capture a share of a market undergoing significant modernization [DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. 9].

**Strategic Fit with the Organization:** The venture's alignment with ServiceNow's corporate strategy is exceptionally strong. Novaworks is building its solution *on* the ServiceNow platform, directly supporting the strategic goal of extending the Now Platform into a core system of record for every major enterprise workflow [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. This creates a native, AI-driven HCM system that enables ServiceNow to directly challenge incumbents like Workday within its own customer base, a scenario explicitly described as a "Workday take out" [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. This makes the venture a core strategic play, not an adjacent or exploratory bet.

**Strategic Edge / Unfair Advantage:** ServiceNow provides a powerful and unique advantage as the venture's primary partner. Novaworks can leverage ServiceNow's enterprise-grade platform, which mitigates customer concerns about security and scalability that typically hinder startups [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. Furthermore, ServiceNow's established go-to-market channels, brand credibility, and existing customer relationships provide a distribution advantage that would otherwise take years and significant capital to build. The planned use of ServiceNow's Workflow Data Fabric and AI infrastructure further deepens this symbiotic relationship, creating a technical and commercial edge that standalone competitors cannot replicate [DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf, p. unknown].

Should we do it? – Yes (High confidence).
Summary rationale: The venture targets a large, strategically vital market and aligns perfectly with ServiceNow's platform strategy, providing a unique corporate advantage to win.

### Can We Do It? (Execution Capacity & Control)

**Hard Assets (Physical/Financial Capacity):** ServiceNow possesses the two critical hard assets required for this venture to succeed: the financial capital to participate in the $7M seed round and, most importantly, the Now Platform itself [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. The platform serves as the foundational technical infrastructure, providing Novaworks with a secure, scalable, and enterprise-ready environment from day one. This eliminates the need for the venture to build its own core infrastructure, dramatically reducing capital requirements and accelerating time-to-market.

**Market Relationship (Market Access):** ServiceNow's ability to provide market access is a core strength of this opportunity. The venture's go-to-market strategy is designed to target ServiceNow's existing enterprise customers, particularly those in the underpenetrated commercial HRSD segment [DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf, p. unknown]. ServiceNow's global sales force has established relationships with the target buyers—CIOs and CHROs—which Novaworks can leverage through the proposed co-sell partnership [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. This direct channel to a qualified customer base significantly de-risks the initial customer acquisition phase.

**Soft Assets (People & Skills):** The venture is led by a team with exceptional "corporate fluency" within the ServiceNow ecosystem. The CEO is a former Chief Innovation Officer at ServiceNow, providing invaluable insider knowledge for navigating the technical and political landscape of the partnership [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. However, a critical execution risk exists within the venture team itself. As an "AI-native" company, the unfilled Chief Data & AI Officer role represents a significant capability gap that threatens its core technical promise and product roadmap, a risk also noted in the *Analysis* table [DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf, p. unknown].

Can we do it? – Yes (Medium confidence).
Summary rationale: ServiceNow provides the critical platform and market access, and the team has the right insider experience, but execution risk is elevated by the venture's pre-product status and a key leadership gap.

### Synthesis & Recommendation

The strategic rationale for this investment is compelling. The venture represents a capital-efficient opportunity for ServiceNow to accelerate its platform strategy, enter the core HCM market, and create a formidable competitor to Workday. The "Should we do it?" analysis is a clear "Yes," as the market is attractive and the strategic fit is nearly perfect. The "Can we do it?" analysis is also positive, as ServiceNow provides the essential platform, capital, and market access needed for success.

However, the execution capacity resides almost entirely within the pre-product, pre-revenue Novaworks team. While the founders are highly credible, their success depends on flawlessly executing an aggressive roadmap and formalizing a complex partnership that currently rests on verbal agreements. The investment allows ServiceNow to catalyze a strategically critical solution while containing risk within a partner-led model. The primary task of due diligence is to gain confidence that the venture's operational plan is as sound as its strategic vision.

**Continue Due Diligence**

The next phase of work must focus on de-risking the execution plan by addressing three critical uncertainties:
1.  **Partnership Formalization:** Can the verbal agreements for ServiceNow's "Skills Intelligence" IP license and the co-sell partnership be formalized into a definitive, written contract that protects both parties' interests?
2.  **Customer Validation:** How firm are the "customer zero" commitments from ServiceNow and Bell Canada, and what is their true willingness to pay a material price for an initial pilot?
3.  **AI Leadership:** What is the plan and candidate pipeline for filling the critical Chief Data & AI Officer role to ensure the "AI-native" thesis can be executed?

### Opportunity Validation

The opportunity is rooted in solving the significant operational and financial burdens of legacy Human Capital Management (HCM) systems, which are ill-equipped for modern workforce demands [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. HR teams spend up to 57% of their time on administrative work, with each manual data entry costing an average of $4.86 [Eddy](https://eddy.com/blog/the-hidden-costs-of-manual-hr/). This problem is most acute for the "deskless" workforce, a segment comprising 80% of global employees that has been historically underserved by traditional HCM technology [DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf, p. unknown]. Novaworks proposes an AI-native HCM platform built on ServiceNow to automate these workflows and provide a unified, conversational experience.

Demand for such a solution is supported by strong market signals. A 2023 Gartner survey identified AI in HR technology as the top emerging priority for HR leaders, indicating a clear market pull for modernization [DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. 9]. The most direct evidence for Novaworks' specific solution is its claim that ServiceNow and Bell Canada—both current Workday customers—have agreed to serve as "customer zero" design partners [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. However, as noted in the *Analysis* table, these commitments are currently unverified and represent the most critical assumption requiring validation.

### Market Summary

The venture targets the global HCM market, which is large and expanding. The Total Addressable Market (TAM) is estimated at $34.1 billion for 2025, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% through 2032 [DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf, p. 6], [Fortune Business Insights](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/human-capital-management-hcm-market-100240). While the company claims a Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) of $12 billion by focusing on the deskless workforce, this is a company-provided estimate that lacks a transparent methodology and is considered low-confidence, as highlighted in the *Claims* table above [DOC: Novaworks_TAM_SAM.pptx, p. 1].

The most significant market trend is the enterprise-wide push to adopt AI, which is creating a clear window of opportunity for a challenger with an AI-first architecture. Novaworks' strategy is to establish a beachhead by targeting a specific niche: mid-sized enterprises (2,000-7,500 employees) that are already invested in the ServiceNow platform [DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf, p. 11, 14]. This approach leverages the convergence of two powerful market forces: the urgent demand for AI-driven HR modernization and the strategic focus on the large, underserved deskless worker segment.

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor / Category | Core Strength | Key Weakness / Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Incumbents (Workday, Oracle)** | Comprehensive feature suites, large enterprise customer base, and strong brand recognition. | Legacy architecture that is not AI-native, expensive, and slow to implement; not optimized for deskless workers [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. |
| **Modern Challengers (Rippling, UKG)** | Strong user experience and modern cloud-native platforms. UKG has a strong focus on workforce management for deskless employees. | Lack deep, native integration with a major enterprise workflow platform like ServiceNow. |
| **ServiceNow (as Partner/Competitor)** | Owns the underlying platform, providing distribution, security, and data fabric advantages. | Has a strong HR Service Delivery (HRSD) offering but lacks a native, full-suite Core HR system of record, creating the gap Novaworks aims to fill [DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf, p. unknown]. |

The competitive dynamic is primarily ecosystem-based. Novaworks is not competing on feature parity alone but on its unique position as a native application within the ServiceNow ecosystem. The "White Space" for the venture is the specific intersection of three attributes: an AI-native architecture, a dedicated focus on the deskless workforce, and native integration with the Now Platform. No single competitor currently occupies this niche, creating a distinct market opening. However, this advantage is fragile, as ServiceNow's own strategic moves, such as its recent collaboration with UKG, could narrow this opening [ServiceNow](https://newsroom.servicenow.com/press-releases/details/2025/ServiceNow-and-UKG-Collaborate-to-Supercharge-Employee-Productivity-and-Efficiency-With-Agentic-AI/default.aspx).

### Regulatory & Legal Landscape Summary

Regulation and intellectual property (IP) represent significant hurdles for Novaworks, not defensible moats. The venture's core function—using AI for employment and workforce management—places its product in a "high-risk" category under emerging global regulations like the European Union's AI Act [Cimplifi](https://www.cimplifi.com/resources/the-updated-state-of-ai-regulations-for-2025/?utm_source=openai). This classification will impose stringent and costly compliance obligations related to data governance, transparency, and human oversight before the product can be sold in key international markets.

From an IP perspective, the company is starting with no proprietary assets, having intentionally avoided development to prevent IP contamination from the founders' prior employment [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. More critically, its plan relies on a "verbal agreement" to license core "Skills Intelligence" IP from ServiceNow. This informal arrangement includes a grant-back clause that requires Novaworks to share back any modifications, creating a material risk that could encumber the value and exclusivity of its own future IP [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. Without formalizing this license and developing a clear compliance roadmap, the legal and regulatory landscape presents a substantial barrier to entry.

### Meta-Analysis: Is This a Valid Opportunity?

The external opportunity is fundamentally valid but highly conditional and carries significant exogenous risks. The validity is rooted in a well-defined problem: legacy HCM systems are inefficient and fail to serve the 80% of the global workforce that is deskless [DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf, p. unknown]. This is coupled with a powerful market catalyst, as AI adoption has become the top emerging technology priority for HR leaders, creating a clear demand for modernization [DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. 9]. Novaworks targets a defensible white space at the intersection of AI-native architecture, a deskless-worker focus, and native ServiceNow integration that no single incumbent or modern challenger currently occupies.

However, the opportunity's attractiveness is conditional on validating several critical external assumptions. The most direct evidence of demand—commitments from "customer zero" partners like ServiceNow and Bell Canada—remains unverified [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. The venture's entire strategic position is predicated on a partnership with ServiceNow that is not yet formalized, and its IP position is encumbered by a verbal agreement with a grant-back clause [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. Therefore, while the market problem, timing, and competitive positioning create an attractive theoretical opportunity, its real-world viability is contingent on securing tangible customer commitments and formalizing the critical partnership and IP agreements that underpin the entire strategy.

## Product & Technology Path

Novaworks' product path is to build an AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) platform from a complete standstill, as no code has been written to date to avoid intellectual property conflicts [CHAPTER: product-and-technology]. The solution is architected for deep integration with the ServiceNow platform, leveraging its core infrastructure, AI components, and a verbal agreement for its Skills Intelligence IP. The core innovation is a conversational "super agent" designed to automate HR workflows for the deskless workforce through an agentic architecture. The roadmap is highly accelerated, aiming to deliver a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within 15 months to align with key industry events [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. This path carries significant execution risk, centered on the team's ability to orchestrate a complex multi-cloud architecture involving ServiceNow, public clouds, and third-party LLMs on an aggressive timeline [CHAPTER: product-and-technology].

## Go-to-Market Path

The go-to-market path is a phased strategy that is entirely dependent on a cornerstone partnership with ServiceNow. The initial entry point targets mid-market organizations with large deskless workforces that are already within the ServiceNow ecosystem, aiming to reduce adoption friction [CHAPTER: gtm-and-partners]. The commercialization plan begins with founder-led sales to secure "Customer Zero" partners like ServiceNow and Bell Canada, with the primary goal of converting them into 3-5 paid pilots within the 15-month seed runway. Success hinges on formalizing the currently verbal agreements with ServiceNow for platform access, co-selling, and IP licensing, which is intended to become the primary channel for customer acquisition and scaling [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown].

## Revenue & Business Model Path

The revenue path is built on a premium-priced, hybrid subscription model that combines recurring fees with usage-based charges, with target annual contract values (ACVs) starting at $325,000 for the entry-level tier [CHAPTER: revenue-model]. This pricing positions Novaworks significantly above established mid-market players, a bet that customers will pay a premium for the value of an AI-native solution deeply integrated into the ServiceNow platform. The projected unit economics are exceptionally optimistic, with LTV/CAC ratios exceeding 100x, and are predicated on achieving extremely low customer acquisition costs through the unproven ServiceNow co-sell channel [DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf, p. unknown]. The model's viability is therefore directly tied to the successful execution of the go-to-market partnership and validation of the premium price point.

## Meta-Analysis: Risks & Opportunities of This Path

Novaworks' strategic path is a high-risk, high-reward play to create a native HCM system of record on the Now Platform. The strategy requires flawless, sequential execution: building a complex, AI-native product from scratch on an accelerated timeline; leveraging this product to formalize a critical co-sell partnership with ServiceNow; and using that partnership to sell a premium-priced solution to enterprise customers. This entire path is built on a foundation of unvalidated, stacked assumptions. The linchpin assumptions that must hold true are the team's ability to execute the complex technical build from a standstill, the successful conversion of verbal agreements with ServiceNow into a formal, favorable partnership for both IP and distribution, and the market's willingness to pay a premium price for a new solution that requires replacing or augmenting a core system of record, as detailed in the *Opportunity Validation* and *Regulatory & Legal Landscape Summary* sections.

The opportunity is strategically compelling for ServiceNow, offering a direct challenge to HCM incumbents like Workday from within its own ecosystem. If successful, Novaworks could achieve rapid scale by leveraging ServiceNow's distribution channels, leading to a valuable acquisition. However, the path is exceptionally fragile. The venture's financial model, with its unrealistic LTV/CAC projections and tight 15-month runway, leaves no margin for error in product development or the 6-9 month enterprise sales cycle [CHAPTER: revenue-model], [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. The dependency on ServiceNow is both the venture's greatest asset and its single point of failure; any shift in ServiceNow's strategy could render the business model unviable. The investment thesis rests on the belief that the experienced founding team can navigate these significant technical, commercial, and partnership risks simultaneously.

## Unit Economics Summary

Novaworks' projected unit economics are exceptionally aggressive and currently unsubstantiated by any operational data. The company forecasts a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) that declines to $95,380 and a Lifetime Value (LTV) over $10 million, yielding an LTV/CAC ratio of 105.7x by its third year of operations [CHAPTER: unit-economics]. These figures are entirely **Projected** with very low confidence, as the company is pre-revenue and lacks any pilot data to validate its assumptions. The model's viability hinges on achieving a premium price point starting at a $325,000 annual contract value (ACV), a steep and unexplained 70% decline in CAC over two years, and rapid gross margin expansion from 54% to over 79% [CHAPTER: unit-economics], [DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf, p. 11]. As a pre-product company, none of these assumptions have been validated, rendering the current model a high-risk hypothesis rather than a credible forecast.

## Financials & Operational Plan

The financial trajectory and operational plan are built on a series of optimistic assumptions that are not internally consistent. The plan requires a $7 million seed investment to fund 15-16 months of operations, with a goal of reaching near-EBITDA breakeven by the end of Year 3 on $13.1 million in revenue [CHAPTER: finance-and-operations], [DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf, p. 15, 16].

*Source: [CHAPTER: finance-and-operations], [CHAPTER: unit-economics]. All figures are management projections.*

The operational plan is undermined by a significant discrepancy between the stated initial hiring plan of 15-17 employees and the financial model's Year 1 personnel expense, which implies a 47-person headcount [CHAPTER: finance-and-operations], [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown], [DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf, p. 16]. This inconsistency suggests the financial model is not grounded in a realistic operational plan. Furthermore, the 15-month runway provides a minimal buffer for common early-stage challenges, such as product development delays or a longer-than-expected 6-9 month sales cycle, creating a high risk of premature insolvency if revenue targets are missed [CHAPTER: finance-and-operations], [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown].

## Legal & IP Constraints

The venture's operational path is constrained by significant legal and intellectual property risks that directly impact its ability to execute. The most critical constraint is the reliance on an unformalized "verbal agreement" to license core "Skills Intelligence" IP from ServiceNow [CHAPTER: legal-and-ip], [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown]. This creates an immediate operational bottleneck, as development cannot proceed with certainty until a formal written agreement is executed. The verbal agreement also includes a grant-back clause, which could operationally encumber the R&D team by requiring them to share proprietary improvements back to ServiceNow, potentially limiting the venture's ability to build a defensible, independent IP moat [CHAPTER: legal-and-ip], [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown].

Furthermore, the platform's core function—using AI for employment and workforce management—places it in a "high-risk" category under emerging regulations like the EU AI Act [CHAPTER: legal-and-ip], [Cimplifi](https://www.cimplifi.com/resources/the-updated-state-of-ai-regulations-for-2025/?utm_source=openai). This imposes a substantial compliance burden that must be integrated into the product development lifecycle from day one, requiring investment in data governance, transparency, and risk management that can slow down an agile, pre-product team and increase development costs. Finally, the lack of executed IP assignment agreements with founders presents a foundational risk that could disrupt operations and complicate future financing or acquisition events if not rectified immediately upon funding [CHAPTER: legal-and-ip], [DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown].

## Meta-Analysis: Execution Readiness, Risks & Opportunities

Novaworks' execution readiness is **Weak**. While the venture is led by a highly credible team with exceptional founder-market fit and is targeting a well-timed market opportunity, the operational and financial foundations required to execute its strategy are critically flawed. The plan is built upon an unreliable financial model with unrealistic unit economics and a significant internal inconsistency regarding the Year 1 hiring plan. This disconnect between the strategic vision and the operational budget suggests the company does not yet have a viable plan to get from its current pre-product stage to initial market traction.

The most material operational risks are the direct consequences of this weak foundation. First, the **financial model's unreliability** means the entire plan for resource allocation, hiring, and runway is built on faulty assumptions. Second, the **insufficient runway** of 15 months provides no margin for error against an aggressive timeline that depends on flawless product development and immediate sales success in a 6-9 month enterprise sales cycle. Any delay will likely trigger a cash crisis before key validation milestones are met. Third, the **unformalized ServiceNow IP license** represents an existential operational threat; development could be halted or the venture's core value could be encumbered by the grant-back clause, undermining the entire investment thesis.

In its current state, the venture does not have the necessary resources, constraints, or economic model to support successful execution. The opportunity lies in the team's potential to correct these foundational issues. If the founders can build a credible, bottoms-up operational and financial plan, formalize the critical ServiceNow partnership, and validate their core pricing assumptions, the venture's strong strategic positioning and experienced leadership could be unlocked. However, without these corrections, the current plan is not executable.

## Next Steps and Action Plan

The recommendation to proceed with a strategic investment is contingent upon the successful and timely resolution of critical uncertainties. The following action plan outlines the immediate next steps required to validate core assumptions and de-risk the venture before committing to full-scale development.

# Six T Analysis

# Chapter: 6T Risk Assessment Memorandum

### 1. Executive Risk Summary

**Overall Project Risk Profile**: This is a high-potential venture led by a proven team that is rendered un-investable for the corporate investor in its current form due to a fatal strategic misalignment.

**Top 3 Critical Risks**:

- **Strategic Misalignment (Source: TAM)**: The venture is designed to be built on a competitor's platform (ServiceNow) with the explicit goal of targeting and displacing the investor's (Workday's) own customers, creating a direct and irreconcilable conflict of interest.
- **Technology & IP Encumbrance (Source: Technology, Terms)**: The venture has no proprietary IP and relies on a precarious verbal agreement to license core technology from ServiceNow, which includes a "share-back" clause that would grant a competitor rights to future innovations.
- **Unvalidated Economics & Traction (Source: Traction)**: The venture is pre-product and pre-revenue, with a business model built on what are assessed to be "unrealistic" financial projections, including a 105.7x LTV/CAC ratio, and lacks any validation from independent customers.

**Key Mitigating Strengths**: The venture is led by a highly experienced founding team with a successful entrepreneurial track record and deep domain expertise. They have assembled a strong advisory board of target customers (CHROs) and have correctly identified a large, underserved market segment in the deskless workforce.

**Overall Confidence in Analysis**: High.

The source documents provide clear, consistent evidence of the critical strategic, legal, and commercial risks that make the venture untenable in its current configuration.

**Strategic Recommendation**: **No-Go** on the investment under the current terms and strategy. The venture requires a fundamental strategic pivot away from the competitor's platform to become an investable opportunity for this corporate investor.

**The Core Decision**: The decision is not about the quality of the team or the market opportunity, but whether the founding team is coachable and willing to undertake a significant pivot of their product and go-to-market strategy to align with the investor's ecosystem.

**90-Day De-Risking Plan for Go/No-Go Decision**:

1. **Mandate a Strategic Pivot Plan** (Owner: Project Lead)
2. **Formalize the ServiceNow IP Agreement**

(Owner: Corporate Development)

3. **Secure an Independent Customer Letter of Intent**

(Owner: Project Lead)

### 3. Deep Dive: Diagnostic Analysis & Recommended Actions

---

#### **Team: Diagnostic Deep Dive**

- **A. Core Diagnosis**: The founding team is a significant asset with proven execution capability, but this strength is undermined by a critical leadership gap in their stated area of differentiation (AI) and a strategic misalignment on exit strategy that creates long-term governance risk. The root cause is a singular focus on the ServiceNow ecosystem, which informs their hiring priorities and potential exit paths, linking directly to the fatal flaw identified in the **TAM** analysis.
- **B. Supporting Evidence**:
  - **Leadership Gap**: The crucial role of Chief Data & AI Officer is listed as "TBD" for a venture positioning itself as "AI-native" \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=3J6cyRLXlRvTJOq2lWu7JkfZYqEh0je8%2F9RPCp63UWk%3D), p. 17\].
  - **Misaligned Incentives**: Founders are explicitly open to being acquired by "ServiceNow, or some other vendor," a direct conflict with the corporate investor's strategic interests \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=8pxd6h0Izw8gvXv3rfhCxlCApoTzrRoAh7swLvObSlg%3D), p. 8\].
  - **Key Person Dependency**: The venture has a high dependency on its two co-founders, with an imbalanced initial equity split of 67% for the CEO and 28% for the CTO \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=8pxd6h0Izw8gvXv3rfhCxlCApoTzrRoAh7swLvObSlg%3D), p. 16\].
- **C. Strategic Implication**: While the team is highly capable, their current strategy and incentive structure make them un-investable for this specific corporate investor without a significant pivot and clarification of long-term alignment.
- **Key Assets to Leverage**: The CEO and CTO's proven entrepreneurial track records and extensive executive network. The high-caliber advisory board of CHROs from major enterprises \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=3J6cyRLXlRvTJOq2lWu7JkfZYqEh0je8%2F9RPCp63UWk%3D), p. 18\].
- **Impact on Project Success**: Significant
- **Path Forward: Recommended Actions**:
  - 🎯 **Action 1**: Condition investment on the hiring of a credible Chief Data & AI Officer with a clear equity allocation.
  - **Action 2**: Secure founder agreement on revised exit strategy terms that align with corporate strategic goals, precluding an exit to a direct competitor.
- **Key Discussion Points for Decision-Making**:
  - How coachable is this team, and how willing are they to pivot from a strategy that is deeply integrated into their personal and professional networks?
  - Can we structure the terms to protect our strategic interests if the founders remain committed to an exit path that benefits a competitor?

---

#### **TAM: Diagnostic Deep Dive**

- **A. Core Diagnosis**: The venture's market strategy is fatally flawed from the perspective of the corporate investor (Workday). It is designed to be built on a direct competitor's platform (ServiceNow) with the explicit purpose of displacing the investor's own products in a "WorkDay take out scenario." This fundamental strategic misalignment is the single most critical risk and makes the venture un-investable in its current form.
- **B. Supporting Evidence**:
  - **Direct Competitive Threat**: The venture's plan includes a "WorkDay take out scenario" and aims to displace Workday's own customers \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=8pxd6h0Izw8gvXv3rfhCxlCApoTzrRoAh7swLvObSlg%3D), p. 29\].
  - **Unsubstantiated Market Size**: The claimed $12 billion Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) is a company-provided estimate that lacks a transparent, bottom-up calculation, creating a high risk that the true market is significantly smaller \[DOC: [Novaworks_TAM_SAM.pptx](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_TAM_SAM.pptx?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=ton%2BE4v%2FIj5f5BC7DkWSTATC0FE6RCP%2BLPm9dgDqUUE%3D), p. 1\].
- **C. Strategic Implication**: Investing in this venture would mean directly funding a competitive threat designed to erode the investor's own market share.
- **Key Assets to Leverage**: The venture's core insight into the needs of the large and underserved deskless workforce is valuable and could be redirected.
- **Impact on Project Success**: Critical
- **Path Forward: Recommended Actions**:
  - 🎯 **Action 1**: Mandate a strategic pivot to a platform-agnostic approach or one that aligns with the investor's own ecosystem as a prerequisite for any further consideration.
  - **Action 2**: Require a bottoms-up validation of the Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) based on the newly defined target platform and customer segment.
- **Key Discussion Points for Decision-Making**:
  - Is there any conceivable strategic rationale for funding the growth of a competitor's platform ecosystem, even for a financial return?
  - What would a viable, non-ServiceNow-dependent go-to-market strategy look like, and is the team capable of executing such a pivot?

---

#### **Technology: Diagnostic Deep Dive**

- **A. Core Diagnosis**: The venture has a high-risk technology profile characterized by a complete lack of proprietary IP, a dependency on an unproven "agentic AI" concept, and a precarious, unformalized verbal IP license from a key partner that encumbers future development. The root cause is the decision to build entirely within the ServiceNow ecosystem, which has led to IP taint concerns and a dependency on ServiceNow's "Skills Intelligence" IP, linking directly to the **Terms** and **TAM** risks.
- **B. Supporting Evidence**:
  - **Precarious IP License**: The company has only a "verbal agreement" to license "Skills Intelligence" IP from ServiceNow, which includes a clause requiring them to "share back" any modifications, encumbering their own derivative work \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=8pxd6h0Izw8gvXv3rfhCxlCApoTzrRoAh7swLvObSlg%3D), p. 21\].
  - **No Existing IP**: The company has intentionally created no IP to date due to concerns about "IP taint" from the founders' current employment, meaning it will start with no proprietary assets \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=8pxd6h0Izw8gvXv3rfhCxlCApoTzrRoAh7swLvObSlg%3D), p. 2, 12\].
- **C. Strategic Implication**: The venture lacks a defensible technology moat and its IP position is too uncertain and encumbered to justify an investment at the proposed valuation.
- **Key Assets to Leverage**: The team's clear vision for a next-generation user experience powered by AI. The CTO's experience in building and scaling technology ventures.
- **Impact on Project Success**: Critical
- **Path Forward: Recommended Actions**:
  - 🎯 **Action 1**: Mandate the formalization of the ServiceNow IP license into a written contract as a non-negotiable condition for closing the investment.
  - **Action 2**: Require the development of a proof-of-concept to validate the technical feasibility of the core "agentic AI" before committing significant capital.
- **Key Discussion Points for Decision-Making**:
  - What is the venture's value if the "share-back" clause effectively grants ServiceNow ownership of the core innovation?
  - How can we gain confidence that the "agentic AI" concept is a genuine 10x improvement and not just an incremental feature that incumbents can replicate?

---

#### **Traction: Diagnostic Deep Dive**

- **A. Core Diagnosis**: The venture has no tangible market traction. It is a pre-product, pre-revenue company whose business case is supported only by interest from strategically aligned partners and a financial model built on what are assessed to be "unrealistic" and "unsubstantiated" assumptions. The root cause of this is its early stage, but the reliance on a single partner channel (**TAM**) for its economic assumptions (**Traction**) creates an unacceptably high risk.
- **B. Supporting Evidence**:
  - **Unrealistic Projections**: The financial model projects a 105.7x LTV/CAC ratio by Year 3, a figure described as an "extreme outlier" based on an unproven 70% reduction in customer acquisition costs \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=3J6cyRLXlRvTJOq2lWu7JkfZYqEh0je8%2F9RPCp63UWk%3D), p. 11\].
  - **No Independent Validation**: The company has no paying customers, and all "demand" signals come from "customer zero" partners like Bell Canada, who are already part of the target ServiceNow ecosystem and may not represent the broader market \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=8pxd6h0Izw8gvXv3rfhCxlCApoTzrRoAh7swLvObSlg%3D), p. 8, 19\].
- **C. Strategic Implication**: The complete lack of independent validation and the non-credible financial model mean an investment today is a bet on an unproven hypothesis with no margin of safety.
- **Key Assets to Leverage**: The strong "soft-circled" interest from ServiceNow and Bell Canada can be used to build initial case studies. The high-profile advisory board can facilitate introductions to potential independent pilot customers.
- **Impact on Project Success**: Significant
- **Path Forward: Recommended Actions**:
  - 🎯 **Action 1**: Require the company to secure a signed, non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) from at least one large enterprise customer that is not directly affiliated with the ServiceNow or Bell Canada partnership ecosystem.
  - **Action 2**: Mandate a rebuild of the financial model with defensible, industry-benchmarked assumptions for CAC, churn, and LTV.
- **Key Discussion Points for Decision-Making**:
  - How much of the early partner interest is a genuine commitment to buy versus a strategic move to encourage development on the ServiceNow platform?
  - What is a realistic LTV/CAC for this business, and does the model still work if the ratio is 5-10x instead of 100x?

---

#### **Trends: Diagnostic Deep Dive**

- **A. Core Diagnosis**: The venture is well-aligned with powerful macro trends (AI adoption, platform consolidation, focus on the deskless workforce), but its execution strategy is too fragile to reliably capitalize on them. The core problem is an existential dependency on an unformalized partnership and an unproven core technology, creating a high risk that the venture is both too early and too fragile. This dependency is a direct result of the flawed **TAM** strategy.
- **B. Supporting Evidence**:
  - **Technology immaturity**: The core "agentic AI" is described as the "least proven aspect" of the plan, suggesting the venture may be too early on a technology not yet ready for reliable enterprise use \[CHAPTER: Product & Technology\].
  - **Existential Partnership Dependency**: The venture's success is entirely dependent on a single, unformalized partnership with ServiceNow, which represents a "single point of failure" \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=8pxd6h0Izw8gvXv3rfhCxlCApoTzrRoAh7swLvObSlg%3D), p. 3\].
- **C. Strategic Implication**: Favorable market timing cannot overcome a flawed and fragile execution strategy, making it likely the venture will fail to capture the opportunity it has identified.
- **Key Assets to Leverage**: The strong, validated market pull for AI in HR and solutions for the deskless workforce.
- **Impact on Project Success**: Significant
- **Path Forward: Recommended Actions**:
  - 🎯 **Action 1**: Commission third-party technical diligence to assess the maturity and enterprise-readiness of "agentic AI" for core HR functions.
  - **Action 2**: Require the development of a credible "Plan B" strategy that reduces the dependency on the ServiceNow channel.
- **Key Discussion Points for Decision-Making**:
  - Are we comfortable making a bet on a core technology that our own diligence suggests is not yet mature?
  - If the ServiceNow partnership sours or fails to deliver, does this business have any other viable path to market?

---

#### **Terms: Diagnostic Deep Dive**

- **A. Core Diagnosis**: The proposed investment terms carry a high degree of risk due to a critical legal encumbrance and an aggressive valuation. The central problem is a verbal, unformalized IP licensing agreement with ServiceNow that includes a "share-back" clause, creating a material legal risk that is not reflected in the pre-product, pre-revenue valuation. This issue is a direct consequence of the flawed **Technology** and **TAM** strategy.
- **B. Supporting Evidence**:
  - **Critical Legal Risk**: The deal has significant "hair" due to a "verbal agreement to utilize the Skills Intelligence of ServiceNow" that "requires sharing of any modifications made to that IP back to ServiceNow," creating a legal and IP nightmare \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=8pxd6h0Izw8gvXv3rfhCxlCApoTzrRoAh7swLvObSlg%3D), p. 21\].
  - **Aggressive Valuation**: The company is seeking a $18-25 million pre-money valuation while being pre-product and pre-revenue, with its entire development plan contingent on this funding round \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A38%3A45Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A38%3A45Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=8pxd6h0Izw8gvXv3rfhCxlCApoTzrRoAh7swLvObSlg%3D), p. 2\].
- **C. Strategic Implication**: The unresolved legal and IP risks make the current terms unacceptable, as they could severely compromise the venture's long-term value and exit potential.
- **Key Assets to Leverage**: The clean capitalization table and standard founder vesting terms provide a solid foundation for restructuring the deal once the core risks are addressed.
- **Impact on Project Success**: Critical
- **Path Forward: Recommended Actions**:
  - 🎯 **Action 1**: Make the formalization and legal review of the ServiceNow IP agreement a non-negotiable closing condition.
  - **Action 2**: Restructure the investment as a tranched deal or convertible note tied to the achievement of key de-risking milestones (e.g., technical proof-of-concept, independent customer LOI).
- **Key Discussion Points for Decision-Making**:
  - Are we willing to invest in a company where a primary competitor may have rights to its core derivative IP?
  - What is a defensible valuation for this company once the strategic and IP risks are properly accounted for?

# Opportunity Validation

## Overview

Novaworks aims to solve the inefficiency and high cost of legacy Human Capital Management (HCM) systems, which burden HR teams with manual tasks and fail to serve the 80% of global workers who are "deskless." The solution is an AI-native HCM platform built entirely on ServiceNow, targeting enterprises seeking to modernize their HR technology. This presents a priority for ServiceNow as it directly extends the Now Platform into a core system of record, enabling a direct competitive challenge to incumbents like Workday and reinforcing the platform's strategic value for enterprise-wide workflow automation. Evidence for the opportunity is rooted in strong market signals for AI in HCM and company-claimed "customer zero" commitments from ServiceNow and Bell Canada, though this direct demand requires verification. The immediate next step is to validate these customer commitments and formalize the partnership while funding the development of a minimum viable product, with the first major milestone being a functional demo in January 2026.

### Key Takeaways

- **Critical Fact 1**: The entire opportunity is predicated on Novaworks building its solution *on* the ServiceNow platform, creating a unique strategic alignment that extends ServiceNow into a core HCM system of record to challenge incumbents like Workday.
- **Critical Fact 2**: The most critical evidence for demand—commitments from "customer zero" partners ServiceNow and Bell Canada—is currently unverified and represents the single most significant assumption that must be validated before committing further resources.

## Risks

- **Execution Risk**: Novaworks is a pre-product, pre-revenue company with no intellectual property built to date. The proposed timeline to deliver a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by early 2026 is aggressive and carries significant technical and operational risk.
- **Validation Risk**: The claimed "customer zero" commitments from major enterprises like ServiceNow and Bell Canada are the primary evidence of problem-solution fit. If these commitments are not formalized or are less substantial than presented, the core validation for the opportunity is undermined.
- **Market Adoption Risk**: The business model requires customers to either replace a core system of record (e.g., Workday) or pay to run a parallel system. This represents a high-friction sales motion with a significant switching cost, and the market's willingness to do so has not been validated beyond the unconfirmed "customer zero" claims.
- **Partnership Dependency**: The go-to-market strategy is entirely dependent on a deep, formalized partnership with ServiceNow for co-selling and distribution. Failure to execute this partnership effectively would leave Novaworks without a viable path to market.

## Next Steps

**Additional Evidence**

- **Verify "Customer Zero" Commitments**: Obtain formal documentation (e.g., Letter of Intent, signed pilot agreement) within 30 days to confirm the status and scope of the commitments from ServiceNow, Bell Canada, and Ateko. This directly addresses the primary Validation Risk.

**Derisking Actions**

- **Finalize Seed Investment**: Execute legal documentation for the $1M seed investment from ServiceNow Ventures within the next 30 days to provide the necessary operational runway for the validation plan.
- **Formalize Partnership Agreements**: Codify the "Customer Zero" pilot terms, IP licensing for ServiceNow's Skills Intelligence, and the initial framework for a go-to-market partnership. This action targets the Partnership Dependency risk.
- **Establish Joint Governance**: Form a joint steering committee with representatives from ServiceNow’s Employee Workflows business unit and Novaworks leadership to ensure strategic alignment and monitor progress against the validation path.
- **Evaluate Initial MVP**: Assess the limited MVP demo scheduled for the January 2026 ServiceNow Partner Kickoff. This serves as the first major go/no-go checkpoint to validate technical execution and de-risk the Execution Risk.

Enterprises face significant operational and financial burdens from legacy Human Capital Management (HCM) systems that are inefficient, costly, and ill-equipped for modern workforce demands \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A43Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A43Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=MpqtKO34Y5fYV%2BsRF9fGQ58pP%2FeoDb6VOnYIn0%2B2sDc%3D), p. unknown\]. These systems create quantifiable drains on productivity and resources. Manual data entry by HR professionals costs an average of $4.86 per instance, and HR teams spend up to 57% of their time on administrative work instead of strategic initiatives [Business Wire — Paycom Reveals Record-High Cost of Manual HR Tasks, Based on EY Study](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251015555659/en/Paycom-Reveals-Record-High-Cost-of-Manual-HR-Tasks-Based-on-EY-Study), [Eddy — The Hidden Costs of Manual HR: Why 57% of HR Professionals are Overwhelmed and How Small Businesses Can Fight Back](https://eddy.com/blog/the-hidden-costs-of-manual-hr/). The financial impact is compounded by errors, with each payroll mistake costing an average of $291 to correct [Eddy — The Hidden Costs of Manual HR: Why 57% of HR Professionals are Overwhelmed and How Small Businesses Can Fight Back](https://eddy.com/blog/the-hidden-costs-of-manual-hr/). At a macro level, outdated HR systems result in losses estimated at nearly $1 billion annually in the public sector alone [PR Newswire — Outdated HR Systems Cost Government $1 Billion Annually, New Workday Report Shows](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/outdated-hr-systems-cost-government-1-billion-annually-new-workday-report-shows-302451828.html).

This problem is particularly acute for the "deskless" workforce—including employees in retail, manufacturing, and logistics—who constitute 80% of the global workforce but have been historically underserved by traditional HCM technology \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A43Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A43Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=MpqtKO34Y5fYV%2BsRF9fGQ58pP%2FeoDb6VOnYIn0%2B2sDc%3D), p. unknown\], \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A43Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A43Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=rArOYo0OLKIBidSyA7vWrc1%2B%2Bkjn1n%2F7wuHymfOW9xE%3D), p. unknown\]. These employees require mobile-first, accessible tools that are not typically prioritized by incumbent platforms.

### Current Solutions and Gaps

The current HCM market is fragmented, forcing enterprises to choose between two suboptimal options. On one side, vendors like Rippling and HiBob serve the mid-market but are considered too small to scale with growing companies \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A43Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A43Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=MpqtKO34Y5fYV%2BsRF9fGQ58pP%2FeoDb6VOnYIn0%2B2sDc%3D), p. unknown\]. On the other side, enterprise incumbents such as Workday and SAP SuccessFactors are expensive to implement and maintain, and their legacy architecture is not inherently designed for an AI-native, agentic operating model \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A43Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A43Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=MpqtKO34Y5fYV%2BsRF9fGQ58pP%2FeoDb6VOnYIn0%2B2sDc%3D), p. unknown\].

This creates a distinct market gap for an AI-native HCM platform that can both scale to enterprise needs and address the specific requirements of the deskless workforce \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A43Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A43Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=rArOYo0OLKIBidSyA7vWrc1%2B%2Bkjn1n%2F7wuHymfOW9xE%3D), p. unknown\]. Novaworks proposes to fill this gap by offering a solution that reduces the total cost of ownership and technical complexity by leveraging a unified platform architecture \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A43Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A43Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=MpqtKO34Y5fYV%2BsRF9fGQ58pP%2FeoDb6VOnYIn0%2B2sDc%3D), p. unknown\].

### Corporate Advantage and Strategic Alignment

Novaworks presents a compelling strategic fit for ServiceNow by directly addressing a core corporate objective: extending the Now Platform into every major enterprise workflow. The opportunity moves beyond a simple partnership, as Novaworks is building its entire AI-native HCM solution *on* the ServiceNow platform \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A43Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A43Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=MpqtKO34Y5fYV%2BsRF9fGQ58pP%2FeoDb6VOnYIn0%2B2sDc%3D), p. unknown\]. This approach provides ServiceNow with a unique and powerful corporate advantage.

The strategic alignment is evident across several dimensions, as detailed in the table below.

</table>

By supporting Novaworks, ServiceNow can accelerate its strategy to capture the core HCM market, deepen its wallet share within existing enterprise accounts, and reinforce the Now Platform as the central nervous system for modern, AI-powered business operations.

## Market Timing & Catalysts

The opportunity for an AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) solution is driven by a convergence of technological maturity, shifting enterprise priorities, and competitive repositioning. The timing is predicated on recent market changes that create a window for a new entrant to challenge incumbents.

### Enabling Factors: The Convergence of AI Maturity and Platform Strategy

The viability of an AI-native HCM platform has been unlocked by two primary factors within the last 24 months: the rapid maturation of generative AI and the strategic evolution of enterprise platforms like ServiceNow.

- **Generative AI Adoption:** The use of generative AI in the workplace has accelerated, with global adoption jumping from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024 [GFoundry — 2025 Global Human Capital Trends](https://gfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DI_2025-Global-Human-Capital-Trends-From-GFoundry.pdf). This widespread adoption has moved AI from a hypothetical advantage to a core business requirement. Novaworks asserts that this technological shift has lowered the barriers to entry for disrupting legacy HCM providers \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Platform-First Enterprise Strategy:** Enterprises are increasingly standardizing on single platforms to improve efficiency and manage AI transformation \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\]. ServiceNow's strategic positioning as a "Platform of Platforms" with investments in a unified "Workflow Data Fabric" provides the necessary technical foundation for an integrated, AI-driven application like Novaworks to operate across enterprise data silos \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This aligns with the strategic fit discussed in the *Problem Definition & Strategic Fit* section.

### Urgency Drivers: Market Pull and Incumbent Inefficiency

Demand for AI within HR functions is no longer speculative; it is a stated priority for HR leaders, creating a strong market pull.

- **Prioritized AI Investment:** A 2023 Gartner survey of 349 HR leaders identified "AI in rest of HR technology (including generative AI)" as their most important emerging technology priority \[DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. 9\]. This is reinforced by a separate report stating that two-thirds of enterprises are expected to require AI-enabled capabilities in their HCM systems by 2027 [Business Wire — AI Becoming Essential to HCM, ISG Says](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250321088492/en/AI-Becoming-Essential-to-HCM-ISG-Says).
- **Legacy System Gaps:** Novaworks claims that over 70% of mid-market and enterprise HR teams operate with fragmented tech stacks that lack AI-native capabilities \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\]. Incumbent solutions from vendors like Workday and SAP are described as expensive and not built to empower a modern AI strategy at scale, creating an opportunity for a challenger built with an AI-first architecture \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Economic Pressure:** A persistent executive mandate to "do more with less" is driving demand for automation that can increase managerial spans of control and lower operating costs, a core component of the Novaworks value proposition \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Competitive Dynamics: A Land Grab for AI Technology

The HCM market is experiencing significant M&A activity, indicating that established players recognize the AI technology gap and are moving to address it through acquisition. This creates both a threat and a validation of the market timing.

- **Incumbent AI Acquisitions:** In August and September 2025, market leader Workday acquired three separate AI firms (Flowise, Paradox, and Sana) to integrate AI into its platform [WorldatWork — Recent HR Software Acquisitions Point to More AI-Focused Future](https://worldatwork.org/publications/workspan-daily/recent-hr-software-acquisitions-point-to-more-ai-focused-future). This reactive "buy" strategy from incumbents highlights the urgency and validates the importance of AI capabilities, while also creating a window for a natively built solution to differentiate itself from bolted-on technologies.
- **High-Value Market Consolidation:** The HCM sector has seen major transactions, including Thoma Bravo's $12.3 billion acquisition of Dayforce in August 2025 and ADP's acquisition of WorkForce Software in October 2024 [Reuters — Thoma Bravo to buy Dayforce in $12.3 billion deal](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/thoma-bravo-buy-dayforce-123-billion-deal-2025-08-21/), [Reuters — ADP raises annual revenue growth forecast following WorkForce Software acquisition](https://www.reuters.com/technology/adp-raises-annual-revenue-growth-forecast-following-workforce-software-2024-10-30/). This activity signals strong investor confidence and high strategic value in the market.

### Window of Opportunity Assessment

The confluence of market-ready AI technology, clear customer demand, and reactive M&A from incumbents creates a time-sensitive window of opportunity.

</table>

Waiting a year would likely result in a more crowded market where incumbents have made further progress in integrating their acquired AI technologies, potentially diminishing the "AI-native" differentiation. The current moment presents a clear opportunity to address validated market demand before the competitive landscape solidifies.

## Demand Signals & Validation Evidence

Evidence for customer demand for an AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) solution is supported by strong indirect market signals, though direct demand for Novaworks' specific product remains based on company-reported claims that require validation. The most significant indicators are the broad, technology-driven shifts in the HCM market and preliminary interest from strategic partners.

### Direct and Indirect Demand Signals

The available evidence for demand can be categorized from direct, company-specific signals to broader, independently verified market trends.

### Critical Assumptions and Validation Gaps

While market tailwinds are strong, Novaworks' success depends on several critical, unverified assumptions. Validating these points, as outlined in the *Resource Requirements & Validation Path* section, represents the most immediate priority.

1. **Nature of "Customer Zero" Commitments**: The most critical assumption is the claim that ServiceNow and Bell Canada will serve as initial customers. The diligence questionnaire states both are Workday customers, making their commitment a powerful validation signal for a "take out" or augmentation strategy \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. However, the current evidence is entirely company-reported. The formal status of these agreements—whether they are verbal commitments, letters of intent, or signed contracts—is unknown and must be verified.

2. **Willingness to Replace or Augment Core HCM**: Novaworks acknowledges that its business model requires customers to either replace their existing HCM or pay to run Novaworks' system in parallel \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The "customer zero" commitments are the primary evidence for this willingness, but without independent validation, the readiness of the broader market to incur the cost and complexity of this change remains a significant unknown.

3. **Validated Demand from Deskless Workers**: The company's focus on the deskless workforce is a key part of its strategy, citing that this segment comprises 80% of the global workforce \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\]. While the market size is substantial, there is a gap in independent evidence confirming that this segment has a specific, urgent need for an *AI-native* HCM solution that existing platforms fail to address. The claim that 44% of these workers expect better technology is a company assertion requiring external validation \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\].

## Resource Requirements & Validation Path

To de-risk the opportunity, Novaworks must validate its core assumptions through a phased approach focused on technical execution, partnership formalization, and initial customer adoption. The company has outlined a validation path tied to key industry events, requiring a $7 million seed investment to fund operations for 15 months \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 15\].

### Critical Assumptions for Validation

The success of Novaworks hinges on three primary assumptions that require immediate testing, directly addressing the gaps identified in the *Demand Signals & Validation Evidence* section:

1. **Market Adoption:** That target customers are willing to either replace their existing Human Capital Management (HCM) systems or adopt Novaworks as a supplementary AI-driven solution \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 3\].
2. **Strategic Partnership:** That a formal partnership with ServiceNow can be secured, including tangible co-sell and co-market commitments that provide a viable go-to-market channel \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 3\].
3. **Technical Execution:** That the company can develop and deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on an accelerated timeline, given that no intellectual property has been built to date due to potential conflicts with the founders' prior employment \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 13\].

### Proposed Validation Path and Milestones

Novaworks proposes a three-phase validation plan designed to test its core assumptions and achieve problem-solution fit before scaling.

</table>

### Resource Requirements

The validation plan is contingent upon securing the requested seed funding.

- **Funding:** A $7 million seed round is required to provide a 15-month operational runway \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 15\]. The company reports soft-circled commitments totaling $4-5 million from ServiceNow Ventures, BCE, and an SPV \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 16\].
- **Personnel:** The initial team will consist of 4-5 US-based employees, one employee in Dubai, and 10 in India. The company plans to use contractors to augment the engineering team to meet MVP deadlines \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 9\].
- **Budget Allocation:** The Year 1 budget allocates $4.1 million for FTE expenses, with a primary focus on product development (56% for R&D) and a secondary focus on initial go-to-market preparations (44% for Sales & G&A) \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 15\].

### Success Metrics and Go/No-Go Criteria

Clear metrics are necessary at each stage to guide the decision to proceed, pivot, or terminate the initiative.

## Strategic Options & Next Steps

Based on Novaworks’ pre-product status and its foundational strategy of building on the ServiceNow platform, the primary strategic decision is not a conventional build-versus-buy analysis but rather defining the optimal structure and timeline for engagement. The company’s plan is inherently a partnership, making the key variables the depth of integration, the level of investment, and the path to a potential future acquisition.

### Evaluation of Strategic Options

Three primary strategic paths exist for engaging with Novaworks. The analysis below evaluates each option based on speed to market, strategic alignment, and resource commitment.

WorldatWork.

\- **Execution Risk:** As a pre-product company, Novaworks carries significant execution risk until it delivers a functional MVP and secures design partners. br- **Limited Control:** ServiceNow will have influence as an investor and partner but not direct control over the product roadmap or operational execution.

</table>

The recommended path is **Option 1: Strategic Investment & Partnership**. This approach provides the most balanced risk-reward profile, allowing ServiceNow to validate the opportunity with minimal initial capital while securing a strategic foothold and maintaining future acquisition as a viable outcome.

### Recommended Next Steps & Validation Path

To execute the recommended strategy, a series of immediate actions and clear validation milestones are required. The Employee Workflows business unit should lead the engagement, with close collaboration from ServiceNow Ventures. This path directly corresponds to the validation plan detailed in the *Resource Requirements & Validation Path* section.

# Product and Technology

## Overview

Novaworks is building an AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) platform on ServiceNow, centered around a conversational "super agent" to automate HR workflows, specifically targeting the deskless workforce. The core innovation is its agentic architecture, which aims to provide a unified, proactive user experience, contrasting with legacy systems that have merely added AI features. The venture plans to leverage ServiceNow's core platform, AI/data infrastructure, and a verbal agreement for its Skills Intelligence IP, capitalizing on the founding team's deep expertise with the ecosystem. Key technical uncertainties include the complex orchestration of a multi-cloud architecture, ensuring robust data security for sensitive HR information, and achieving reliable performance at scale. A 20-week, three-phase validation plan is proposed to test these core assumptions, starting with a proof-of-concept for the AI agent before committing to full development.

### Key Takeaways

- **Critical Fact 1**: The entire strategy is built on native integration with the ServiceNow platform, leveraging its infrastructure, AI components, and go-to-market channels. This deep alignment is both its greatest strength and most critical dependency.
- **Critical Fact 2**: The project is pre-product and pre-code. Success hinges entirely on the team's ability to execute a complex technical orchestration of multiple systems (ServiceNow, public cloud, third-party LLMs) on an aggressive 15-month timeline.

## Risks

- **Execution Risk**: The team is starting from a complete standstill and must integrate multiple complex systems—including the Now Platform, a public cloud, commercial LLMs, and a vector database—into a reliable, enterprise-grade product on a highly accelerated timeline.
- **Partnership Dependency**: The venture's technical and commercial viability is critically dependent on formalizing its strategic partnership with ServiceNow. This includes co-sell agreements and a definitive license for the Skills Intelligence IP, which is currently based only on a verbal agreement.
- **Data Security and Compliance**: Using autonomous AI agents and third-party LLMs to process highly sensitive employee data creates significant security, privacy, and regulatory compliance risks that are challenging to mitigate in a multi-cloud environment.
- **Performance at Scale**: The "super agent" value proposition requires consistent, low-latency performance. The complex, multi-step workflows involving external LLMs could introduce performance bottlenecks and unpredictable API costs as the user base grows.

## Next Steps

**Additional Evidence**

- **Formalize ServiceNow Partnership**: Obtain a signed Letter of Intent or Term Sheet from ServiceNow that outlines the specific terms of the co-sell agreement and the non-exclusive license for its Skills Intelligence IP to convert the verbal agreement into a formal commitment.

**Derisking Actions**

- **Execute Phase 1 PoC**: Fund and execute the 6-week Proof of Concept for the core agentic logic, as defined in the Technical Validation Strategy, to test the primary technical assumption before committing further resources to integration and development.
- **Develop Security Protocol**: Create a detailed data governance and security protocol document specifying how Personally Identifiable Information (PII) will be handled, segregated, and protected across the multi-cloud architecture, with a specific focus on data flows to and from third-party LLMs.
- **Model Latency and Cost**: Conduct a preliminary technical analysis to model the expected end-to-end latency and API costs for the 3-5 most common user workflows at scales of 1,000 and 10,000 concurrent users to assess scalability risks early.

## Solution Scope & Architecture

Novaworks is developing an AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) platform built on ServiceNow.

The solution is designed to automate HR workflows and provide a unified, conversational interface for employees, with a specific focus on the historically underserved deskless workforce \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A51Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A51Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=J1HU%2BCsn%2BiROfGF6cR1mZKLBHUbrBbGLb8%2FlUl%2FxdrY%3D), p. unknown\].

### Core Functionality

The platform's core function is to serve as a comprehensive HCM system covering the entire employee lifecycle, from hiring to retirement. It aims to replace or augment legacy HCM systems by using an "agentic" architecture, where AI agents proactively and reactively manage HR tasks \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A51Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A51Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=J1HU%2BCsn%2BiROfGF6cR1mZKLBHUbrBbGLb8%2FlUl%2FxdrY%3D), p. unknown\]. The central feature is a "super agent," a voice-enabled, conversational assistant designed to provide a single point of contact for any employee interaction or task, similar to a Siri-like experience \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A51Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A51Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=J1HU%2BCsn%2BiROfGF6cR1mZKLBHUbrBbGLb8%2FlUl%2FxdrY%3D), p. unknown\].

For employees, the system is intended to deliver hyper-personalized tools, notifications, and support. For managers, it aims to increase operational efficiency and expand their span of control through automation \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A51Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A51Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=J1HU%2BCsn%2BiROfGF6cR1mZKLBHUbrBbGLb8%2FlUl%2FxdrY%3D), p. unknown\]. The initial target users are exemplified by "Maria," a warehouse manager, and "James," a new machine operator, highlighting the focus on non-office-based roles \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A51Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A51Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=Mjr8if31ZXCPAPzuxAKO4SvtAW7F0T0rXiIsDmNjBwo%3D), p. unknown\].

### Technical Architecture

The Novaworks solution is architected as a multi-tenant, platform-independent set of capabilities that are initially deployed on the ServiceNow platform and a public cloud (AWS or Azure) \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A51Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A51Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=Mjr8if31ZXCPAPzuxAKO4SvtAW7F0T0rXiIsDmNjBwo%3D), p. unknown\]. The architecture consists of four primary layers:

1. **Frontend & User Interface**: The user-facing components are built within ServiceNow, using its HR Workspace and EC Pro modules, alongside custom components. A "Nova Chat Integrations" module provides the conversational interface \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A51Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A51Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=Mjr8if31ZXCPAPzuxAKO4SvtAW7F0T0rXiIsDmNjBwo%3D), p. unknown\].
2. **AI & Agent Layer (Nova GPT)**: This layer orchestrates the AI functionality. It uses an agentic framework, explicitly mentioning the use of LangChain, a common open-source toolkit for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs) \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A51Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A51Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=J1HU%2BCsn%2BiROfGF6cR1mZKLBHUbrBbGLb8%2FlUl%2FxdrY%3D), p. unknown\], [Medium](https://medium.com/@admin_52806/the-top-5-frameworks-driving-the-agentic-ai-revolution-in-2025-ad9006e17e09). This layer combines commercial LLMs with a proprietary "Nova SLM" (Small Language Model) \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A51Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A51Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=Mjr8if31ZXCPAPzuxAKO4SvtAW7F0T0rXiIsDmNjBwo%3D), p. unknown\].
3. **Data & Knowledge Layer (Nova Codex)**: This is a serverless data lakehouse that ingests public, partner, and customer data. It uses custom transformers to process and store this information in a vector database, which is essential for providing context to the AI agents \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A51Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A51Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=Mjr8if31ZXCPAPzuxAKO4SvtAW7F0T0rXiIsDmNjBwo%3D), p. unknown\].
4. **Integration Layer**: An "Integration Hub" and "Workflow Data Fabric" connect the platform to external systems for functions such as payroll, background checks, and e-signatures \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A51Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A51Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=Mjr8if31ZXCPAPzuxAKO4SvtAW7F0T0rXiIsDmNjBwo%3D), p. unknown\].

### Innovation Elements

The primary innovation claimed by Novaworks is not a single new technology but the synthesis of existing technologies into an "AI-native" HCM platform, as opposed to a legacy system with AI features added on. Key innovative elements include:

- **Agentic Architecture**: The solution is designed around autonomous AI agents that can execute complex, multi-step HR workflows, aiming to reduce manual intervention and increase manager efficiency \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Deskless Workforce Focus**: The product is purpose-built for the needs of frontline workers, a segment that comprises 80% of the global workforce but has been historically underserved by traditional HCM systems \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Unified "Super Agent" Experience**: Consolidating all employee interactions into a single, voice-enabled conversational interface is a key differentiator from fragmented, multi-application HR tech stacks \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Native ServiceNow Integration**: By building on the ServiceNow platform, Novaworks intends to use its security, low-code customization capabilities, and "Workflow Data Fabric" to accelerate deployment and connect siloed enterprise data \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This deep integration is detailed further in the Corporate Capability Alignment section.

### User Experience

The intended user experience centers on simplicity and accessibility, driven by the conversational "super agent." For an employee, this means interacting with a single AI assistant for tasks ranging from requesting time off to inquiring about career development opportunities. For a manager, the experience is designed to automate routine administrative work, such as onboarding new hires or approving schedules, allowing them to focus on higher-value management activities \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\]. The platform aims to provide a "hyper personalized" experience for each employee, delivering proactive notifications and just-in-time support through their preferred communication channels \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

## Technology Feasibility & Maturity

The technical feasibility of Novaworks' proposed solution is assessed as **Medium confidence**. While the core technologies are commercially available and maturing rapidly, significant execution risk exists in orchestrating these components into a reliable, secure, and scalable enterprise-grade Human Capital Management (HCM) platform. The company is not assuming any technical breakthroughs are required; success depends on engineering execution rather than fundamental research and development.

### Technology Readiness and Precedents

Novaworks’ technical approach relies on a combination of mature, commercially available technologies. The core concept of using agentic AI to automate complex HR workflows is well-established, with major enterprise software providers, including ServiceNow, already deploying AI agents in their HR service delivery products [Deel](https://www.deel.com/blog/agentic-ai-tools-for-hr). The broader market trend validates that agentic systems are a viable and increasingly adopted solution for enhancing HR efficiency and workforce planning [Prismforce](https://prismforce.com/blog/agentic-ai-in-hr-the-complete-guide), [Qandle](https://www.qandle.com/blog/how-hr-must-adapt-to-agentic-ai-in-the-workplace/).

The company’s plan to build its agent layer using "publicly available LLMs" and open-source toolkits like LangChain is a standard industry practice \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. These foundational frameworks are sufficiently mature for developing multi-agent systems, providing the necessary components for building the proposed architecture [Blockchain Council](https://www.blockchain-council.org/ai/agentic-ai-tools-frameworks/).

The most significant enabler is the decision to build on the ServiceNow platform. This choice de-risks multiple technical domains by providing a secure, enterprise-grade foundation for workflow automation, user interface development, and data management through its Workflow Data Fabric \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\]. This approach allows Novaworks to focus on its core value proposition—the AI-native HCM application logic—rather than building foundational infrastructure.

### Key Technical Risks and Challenges

Despite the availability of core technologies, Novaworks faces three primary technical risks that will determine its ability to deliver a functional and competitive product. A staged approach to validate these assumptions is outlined in the Technical Validation Strategy section.

1. **Complex System Orchestration:** The primary technical challenge is not in the individual components but in their integration and orchestration. The proposed architecture spans the ServiceNow cloud and a public cloud (AWS or Azure) for its data lakehouse, connecting a custom front-end, multiple AI models (commercial LLM and a custom "Nova SLM"), and a vector database via an agent layer \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\]. Engineering a reliable, low-latency, and seamless "super agent" experience from these disparate parts is a substantial undertaking.
2. **Data Governance and Security:** As an HCM system of record, the platform will handle highly sensitive employee data. Ensuring robust data privacy, security, and regulatory compliance across a multi-cloud architecture that uses third-party LLMs is a critical challenge. While the company plans a "Nova HR Codex for Global Compliance," the implementation of effective governance and risk mitigation for autonomous AI agents remains a significant hurdle that requires specialized frameworks \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15739).
3. **Performance and Scalability:** The value proposition of delivering a "hyper personalized" experience to every employee requires consistent, low-latency performance at scale \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The reliance on external commercial LLMs and complex, multi-step agentic workflows could introduce performance bottlenecks and unpredictable costs as the user base grows to the target enterprise segments of over 20,000 full-time employees \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Required Enablers and Dependencies

The successful development of the Novaworks platform is contingent on the integration and performance of several key external technologies and platforms. The company's strategy mitigates risk by using established services rather than developing foundational technology from scratch.

## Corporate Capability Alignment

Novaworks' strategy demonstrates a high degree of alignment with ServiceNow's existing corporate capabilities, leveraging the Now Platform as its foundational technology. The venture is designed to function as a native extension of ServiceNow's ecosystem rather than a standalone product, which creates significant technical and go-to-market advantages.

### Existing Assets and Platform Leverage

The core of Novaworks' technical strategy is its construction upon the ServiceNow platform, which provides immediate access to a secure, scalable, and enterprise-ready infrastructure \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This approach allows Novaworks to bypass foundational development and focus on building its AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) application layer.

Novaworks plans to use several key ServiceNow assets:

- **Core Platform Services**: The solution will be built using ServiceNow's low-code development platform and will integrate with existing components like HR Workspace and EC Pro \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 10\]. This native integration is intended to reduce deployment complexity for customers already within the ServiceNow ecosystem \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **AI and Data Infrastructure**: The architecture explicitly incorporates ServiceNow's strategic data and AI components, including the Workflow Data Fabric and RaptorDB, to connect disparate enterprise data sources for its AI agents \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The solution is also designed to operate within ServiceNow's AI governance frameworks, such as the AI Control Tower and AI Agent Fabric, which provide orchestration and management for all agents on the platform \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 30, 31\].
- **Intellectual Property**: Novaworks has a verbal agreement to use ServiceNow's Skills Intelligence IP through a non-exclusive license, which provides a critical technology component and accelerates the development of its talent management capabilities \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Internal Expertise and Business Unit Fit

The venture shows strong alignment with ServiceNow's internal talent and strategic business focus. The Novaworks founding team has deep institutional knowledge of the ServiceNow platform, evidenced by their approved conflict of interest filings \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This is further reinforced by an advisory board that includes several current and former ServiceNow executives, providing access to strategic guidance and internal networks \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 18\].

From a business perspective, Novaworks fits directly into the HR Service Delivery (HRSD) business unit's strategy. The go-to-market plan targets existing ServiceNow HRSD customers, particularly in the underpenetrated commercial segment \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 11\]. The designation of ServiceNow as "customer zero" creates an ideal environment for co-development, rapid feedback, and internal validation before a broader market launch \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This aligns with ServiceNow's broader role in the HR technology market, where its platform serves as a central hub for integrating various HR functions [ERP.Today](https://erp.today/servicenows-critical-role-in-todays-hr-tech-market/).

### Capability Gaps and Partnership Strategy

Novaworks' primary capability gap is that the product is not yet built, a deliberate decision to avoid intellectual property contamination while the founders were still employed at ServiceNow \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This presents an execution risk, which is addressed in the Implementation Roadmap & Resources section.

The company's technology strategy relies on a sensible build-versus-buy approach. While building the core HCM application and agentic workflows on the Now Platform, Novaworks plans to use external, best-of-breed technologies for commodity components. This includes using publicly available Large Language Models (LLMs) and open-source agent development frameworks like LangChain, which is a standard tool for building AI agents that can reason through tasks \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], [Medium](https://medium.com/@admin_52806/the-top-5-frameworks-driving-the-agentic-ai-revolution-in-2025-ad9006e17e09).

The most critical dependency is the formalization of the strategic partnership with ServiceNow. Success requires establishing co-sell and co-marketing agreements and potentially developing a combined SKU to simplify procurement for customers \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 14\]. While this is primarily a business development activity, it is fundamental to realizing the technical and product vision.

</table>

## Implementation Roadmap & Resources

Novaworks presents a phased implementation plan designed to progress from its current pre-product status to a commercially scaled solution over approximately 15 months, contingent on securing a $7M seed round \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 15\]. The roadmap prioritizes rapid development to meet key industry event deadlines, followed by a pilot program with committed design partners before broader market expansion. The strategy is predicated on an aggressive timeline, starting development from a complete standstill due to intellectual property restrictions that prevent any code creation until after funding is secured and founders have formally separated from ServiceNow \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Development Phases and Timeline

The company has defined a four-phase path from initial prototype to commercial scaling. This approach includes distinct deliverables and decision gates at each stage to manage risk and validate progress before committing further resources. The initial timeline is accelerated, a pace which is supported by current industry capabilities in rapid AI prototyping that can shorten development cycles from months to weeks [Speed MVPs](https://speedmvps.com/rapid-ai-prototyping), [Hypermode](https://hypermode.com/blog/ai-native-architectures-rapid-iteration-development).

### Resource Allocation

Novaworks plans a lean initial structure focused on product development, with a clear strategy to shift investment toward go-to-market functions as the product matures.

- **Initial Team Structure**: At launch, the team will consist of 4-5 US-based employees, one executive in Dubai, and a 10-person engineering team in India, augmented by contractors as needed \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The total projected headcount for the first year is 47 \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*, p. 16\].
- **Phased Investment**: The allocation of the $4.1M Year 1 FTE expense heavily favors development, with 56% dedicated to R&D. In Year 2, the allocation shifts, with 52% of the $5.8M FTE expense directed to Sales & G&A, reflecting the transition from building the product to selling it \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 15\].
- **Technology Resources**: The technical architecture relies on public cloud infrastructure (AWS or Azure), open-source AI development toolkits like LangChain, and commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*, p. 10\].

### Critical Dependencies

The roadmap's success hinges on several key internal and external factors that must be secured for the plan to remain viable.

- **Funding**: The entire implementation plan is contingent on the successful close of the $7M seed round \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 15\].
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Formalizing the partnership with ServiceNow is the most critical dependency. This includes finalizing terms for co-sell and co-market activities and securing a definitive, non-exclusive license for ServiceNow's Skills Intelligence IP, which is currently based on a verbal agreement \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Design Partner Commitment**: The pilot phase relies on the active participation of "customer zero" partners—ServiceNow, Bell Canada, and Ateko—to provide essential feedback for product iteration \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 14\].

### Scale Considerations

Novaworks' strategy for scaling is built into its product architecture and operational planning. The company intends to grow efficiently before pursuing a larger Series A round to fund a more aggressive expansion.

- **Architectural Scalability**: The solution is designed to serve mid-market customers with an off-the-shelf product while enabling rapid customization for larger enterprises through the ServiceNow low-code development platform \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Operational Scaling**: The company plans to maintain a lean organization, scaling the customer success and sales teams only after the product and initial demand are validated \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. Headcount is projected to grow modestly from 47 to 53 between Year 1 and Year 2, prioritizing capital efficiency \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*, p. 16\].
- **Future Funding for Scale**: Management explicitly states the intention to raise a Series A round after achieving product-market fit to fund the expansion into the large enterprise segment and challenge incumbent vendors like Workday \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

## Technical Validation Strategy

To de-risk the technical development of Novaworks' platform, a staged validation strategy is proposed. This approach prioritizes testing the most critical technical assumptions with minimal resource expenditure before committing to full-scale development, which is essential for a pre-product company \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 13\]. The strategy emphasizes rapid prototyping, a method proven to shorten development cycles and validate concepts quickly [SpeedMVPs](https://speedmvps.com/rapid-ai-prototyping), [Janea Systems](https://www.janeasystems.com/blog/ai-project-failure-rapid-prototyping-solution).

### Key Technical Assumptions

The viability of the Novaworks solution depends on four core technical hypotheses derived from its proposed architecture \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 10\]. These must be validated empirically.

1. **Agentic AI Performance:** The central assumption is that an AI agent built using open-source frameworks like LangChain can reliably orchestrate complex, multi-step Human Capital Management (HCM) workflows (e.g., new hire onboarding, performance reviews) with high accuracy and minimal human intervention \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 24\].
2. **ServiceNow Platform Integration:** The solution's value is predicated on its ability to deeply integrate with the ServiceNow platform. It must leverage core components like EC Pro and the Workflow Data Fabric without introducing performance bottlenecks or compromising the stability of the host environment \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 10\].
3. **LLM Accuracy and Compliance:** The use of commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) for a regulated function like HR introduces risk. The assumption is that these models can be constrained through prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide factually correct, compliant, and non-hallucinatory responses suitable for an enterprise context.
4. **Data Security and Multi-Tenancy:** The proposed multi-tenant architecture must ensure strict data segregation between customers to meet enterprise security and privacy standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 10\].

### Staged Validation Approach

A three-phase approach is recommended to systematically test these assumptions and accelerate learning, consistent with modern AI development practices that favor rapid iteration [Hypermode](https://hypermode.com/blog/ai-native-architectures-rapid-iteration-development).

- **Phase 1: Proof of Concept (PoC) — Core Agentic Logic (Weeks 1-6):** This phase focuses exclusively on the highest-risk element: the AI agent's ability to execute a core HCM workflow. The PoC will be a standalone service, using mock data to isolate and validate the agent's reasoning and task-completion capabilities.
- **Phase 2: Functional Prototype — ServiceNow Integration (Weeks 7-12):** The validated PoC agent will be integrated into a ServiceNow developer instance. This phase will test the technical feasibility of the agent reading from and writing to ServiceNow, validating the core integration hypothesis.
- **Phase 3: Limited Pilot — Design Partner Deployment (Weeks 13-20):** The functional prototype will be deployed in a sandboxed environment for a designated design partner, such as Bell Canada or Ateko \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 14\]. This phase will test the solution against real-world use cases and data (anonymized where necessary) to validate performance and utility.

### Risk Mitigation and Learning Velocity

This staged strategy is designed to mitigate technical risk by front-loading the validation of the most novel and uncertain architectural components. Each phase concludes with a go/no-go decision point, minimizing resource commitment if a core assumption proves invalid. For instance, if the Phase 1 PoC fails to achieve a 90% task completion rate, the project would require a significant architectural review before proceeding, preventing wasted effort on integration. This "fail fast" approach prioritizes learning velocity, ensuring that the development roadmap is continuously informed by empirical evidence rather than static plans.

# Market Research

## Overview

The realistic market opportunity is a niche within the $34.1 billion Human Capital Management (HCM) market, specifically targeting mid-sized ServiceNow customers with deskless workforces. While the overall market is large, the venture's $12 billion serviceable addressable market (SAM) estimate is a low-confidence company claim lacking a transparent methodology. Market dynamics are favorable, driven by AI-led modernization and a focus on the historically underserved deskless segment, creating an opportune time for entry. The competitive landscape is intense, featuring large incumbents like Workday and SAP, but the venture aims to differentiate with an AI-native solution built on the ServiceNow platform. The most critical evidence needed is validation that customers are willing to bear the high costs and disruption of replacing or augmenting their core HCM systems, which can be tested through paid pilot programs and direct customer interviews.

### Key Takeaways

- **Large but Unverified Niche**: The overall HCM market is large and growing ($34.1B), but the venture's $12B serviceable market for the deskless workforce is an unverified, low-confidence company claim that requires a detailed, bottom-up validation.
- **Strategic Conflict**: The core go-to-market strategy relies on a partnership with ServiceNow, a direct competitor to Workday, creating a fundamental strategic misalignment and a single point of failure risk for the internal venture.

## Risks

- **Unsubstantiated Market Size**: The $12B Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) is a company-provided estimate without a transparent, bottom-up calculation, creating a high risk that the true market opportunity is significantly smaller.
- **Platform Dependency**: The entire go-to-market strategy hinges on a currently informal partnership with ServiceNow, a direct competitor. This creates a critical dependency and a single point of failure if the relationship terms change or are not formalized.
- **High Customer Switching Costs**: The venture's success assumes customers will replace or augment deeply embedded core HCM systems. This is a major unproven assumption, as high switching costs present a formidable adoption barrier.
- **Temporary AI Advantage**: The "AI-native" differentiation may be short-lived. Incumbents like Workday and SAP are rapidly integrating advanced AI, which could neutralize the venture's primary value proposition and close the window of opportunity.

## Next Steps

**Additional Evidence**

- **SAM Calculation**: Obtain a detailed, bottom-up calculation for the $12B SAM from the venture team to validate the market size assumption.
- **Formalize Partnership**: Secure a formal, written partnership agreement with ServiceNow to clarify terms, commitments, and risks, moving beyond the current verbal understanding.

**Derisking Actions**

- **Validate Problem-Solution Fit**: Execute Phase 1 of the validation plan by securing formal, written co-design commitments from at least two strategic partners (e.g., Bell Canada, Ateko) within 90 days to confirm enterprise-level interest.
- **Test Willingness to Switch**: Conduct structured interviews with 20-30 target CHROs/CIOs, focusing on current Workday customers, to specifically test the "willingness to replace or augment" assumption, which is the venture's most significant barrier.
- **Confirm Pricing Viability**: Initiate paid MVP pilot programs with 7-10 customers to test the willingness to pay and validate that the ROI supports the proposed premium price point, starting at a $325,000 ACV.
- **Assess Incumbent Threat**: Commission a focused analysis of the AI roadmaps for Workday and SAP SuccessFactors to better quantify the timeline and risk of their AI capabilities neutralizing Novaworks' differentiation.

This figure is consistent with external market analysis from [Fortune Business Insights](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/human-capital-management-hcm-market-100240), which projects the market will grow from $31.34 billion in 2024 to $64.97 billion by 2032, representing a 9.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). A separate forecast from Gartner, focused specifically on HCM software, projects a higher five-year CAGR of 13.6%, with spending expected to exceed $51 billion by 2028 \[DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. unknown\]. The alignment between company claims and independent reports provides high confidence in the overall market size and growth trajectory.

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM**)Novaworks defines its SAM as $12 billion, representing the portion of the HCM market focused on its target deskless workforce \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The provided documents do not contain a detailed, bottom-up calculation to substantiate this figure. As this is a single-source company claim without a transparent methodology, confidence in this specific valuation is low. However, the strategic focus on the deskless segment, which comprises approximately 80% of the global workforce, is logical given its scale and historical lack of dedicated technology solutions \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This segment is also identified as a key opportunity in the *Market Dynamics & Growth Drivers* section.

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM**)The company does not state an explicit SOM but implies its target through financial projections. Novaworks aims to capture $77.5 million in annual bookings by 2028 (Year 3) and $199 million by 2030 \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 12\]. This projection represents the company's near-term obtainable market goal. A detailed analysis of the feasibility of these financial targets is outside the scope of this chapter.

### Market Segmentation & Prioritization

Novaworks employs a multi-layered segmentation strategy to define its initial market entry point. The approach prioritizes customer segments based on worker type, company size, technology stack, and industry vertical.

The primary strategic focus is on the deskless workforce, a large segment that traditional HCM systems have not adequately served \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 5\]. To gain initial traction, Novaworks will target a niche within this broad market: mid-sized enterprises that are already invested in the ServiceNow platform \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 11, 14\]. This approach is designed to reduce customer acquisition friction by leveraging a known technology platform and an existing partner ecosystem. The company plans a phased rollout of vertical-specific solutions, beginning with Transportation and Retail, to build expertise and establish proof points before expanding into other industries \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 8\].

## Market Dynamics & Growth Drivers

The Human Capital Management (HCM) market is a large, mature sector undergoing a significant transformation driven by new technology and evolving workforce demands. The market's growth is steady, supported by durable, long-term trends that favor the entry of specialized, AI-native solutions.

### Growth Trajectory and Projections

The global HCM market is substantial and expanding at a consistent rate. Projections for the market's compound annual growth rate (CAGR) range from 8.5% to 9.6% through the next decade \[DOC: Novaworks_TAM_SAM.pptx, p. 1\], [Fortune Business Insights](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/human-capital-management-hcm-market-100240), [Global Growth Insights](https://www.globalgrowthinsights.com/market-reports/human-capital-management-market-101299), [MarketsandMarkets](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/human-capital-management-market-193746782.html). Novaworks estimates the market will grow from approximately $34 billion in 2025 to $67 billion by 2032 \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 6\].

Analysis from Gartner indicates even stronger growth specifically within the HCM software segment, which it projects will exceed $51 billion by 2028 at a five-year CAGR of 13.6% \[DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. 2\]. This higher growth rate for software underscores a market shift toward technology-centric solutions over services, driven by large-scale modernization initiatives.

### Key Demand Drivers

Three primary forces are shaping the HCM market's evolution and creating opportunities for new entrants. These drivers are durable and mutually reinforcing, signaling a fundamental shift rather than a temporary trend.

### Market Adoption and Timing

The HCM market is at an inflection point. While the core market for HR systems of record is mature, the segment for AI-native platforms is in an early adoption phase. The high prioritization of AI by HR leaders suggests the market is ready for solutions that embed this technology at their core, rather than as an add-on \[DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. 9\]. This creates a favorable, "on-time" window for new entrants with an AI-first architecture to challenge incumbents, who are perceived as slower to adapt their legacy platforms \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 29\]. The specific focus on the underserved deskless workforce further sharpens this timing advantage, targeting a large, recognized area of need with limited competition from existing enterprise solutions.

### Potential Headwinds

Despite the positive growth drivers, several factors could temper the market's trajectory or impact a new entrant's success.

- **Incumbent Adaptation**: A central assumption is that large incumbents like Workday and SAP will be slow to integrate AI natively. If these established players accelerate their AI roadmaps and successfully deploy advanced capabilities, the window of opportunity for new, disruptive entrants could close more quickly than anticipated. This threat is further detailed in the *Competitive Landscape & Positioning* section.
- **Economic Uncertainty**: Large-scale HCM transformation projects represent significant capital expenditures. A broad economic downturn could cause enterprises to delay or scale back these initiatives, slowing market growth and extending sales cycles.
- **Pricing and Value Realization**: Gartner notes that HCM software providers are expected to increase subscription prices by an average of 3% to 5% in the coming years \[DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. 3\]. While this contributes to market revenue growth, it may also increase customer scrutiny on the return on investment, creating pressure for all vendors to clearly demonstrate value.

## Competitive Landscape & Positioning

The Human Capital Management (HCM) market is a mature, multi-billion dollar sector characterized by intense competition among established enterprise suite providers and a dynamic field of specialized mid-market solutions. The primary competitive dynamic is the industry-wide shift toward cloud-based, AI-driven platforms, which is lowering entry barriers for new software firms and forcing incumbents to accelerate innovation \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], [American Edge Project](https://americanedgeproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AEP-AI-Paper.pdf). Novaworks enters this environment by positioning itself as an "AI-native" solution built on the ServiceNow platform, targeting the historically underserved deskless workforce \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 2\].

### Direct Competitors

Novaworks faces direct competition from two distinct categories of players: large enterprise suite vendors and agile mid-market specialists. The company's strategy explicitly targets customers of both, aiming to displace mid-market players and execute a "WorkDay take out scenario" within the enterprise segment \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. As noted in the *Market Validation Strategy* section, the feasibility of this "take out" scenario is a critical assumption that requires testing.

### Indirect Competition & Alternative Solutions

The most significant form of competition is the status quo within target organizations. A majority of mid-market and enterprise HR teams operate with fragmented technology stacks, relying on a combination of legacy systems, disparate point solutions for functions like payroll and recruiting, and manual processes \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 22\]. This creates operational inefficiencies and data silos, which Novaworks aims to solve. Additionally, organizations may opt for custom in-house solutions built on platforms like ServiceNow, representing a "build vs. buy" alternative to Novaworks' productized offering.

### Novaworks' Competitive Positioning & Differentiation

Novaworks positions itself to exploit perceived gaps left by both enterprise and mid-market incumbents. Its differentiation strategy is built on four pillars:

1. **Platform-Native Strategy**: By building on ServiceNow, Novaworks aims to leverage a trusted, secure, and extensible enterprise platform. This is intended to reduce customer concerns about partnering with a startup and capitalize on ServiceNow's existing market penetration and "street cred" \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
2. **AI-Native Architecture**: The solution is designed around an agentic AI core, featuring a "voice-enabled SuperAgent," rather than adding AI as a feature to a legacy system. This architecture is claimed as a key defensible moat \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
3. **Target Segment Focus**: The explicit focus on the deskless workforce—a segment representing 80% of global employees—is a core part of the value proposition, addressing a group historically underserved by traditional HCM systems \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
4. **Founder-Market Fit**: The founding team's domain expertise, particularly the CEO's background as a former CHRO, is positioned as a competitive advantage in product design and go-to-market execution \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Competitive Intensity and Potential Threats

The HCM market's competitive intensity is high and expected to increase. The proliferation of open-source AI tools lowers barriers to entry for new software firms, potentially commoditizing parts of the market [American Edge Project](https://americanedgeproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AEP-AI-Paper.pdf), [AINVEST](https://www.ainvest.com/news/human-capital-algorithms-encore-search-partners-moat-thrives-ai-driven-world-2507/).

Key threats include:

- **Incumbent AI Adoption**: Enterprise players like SAP and Oracle are actively integrating AI into their platforms, with SAP launching its Joule AI copilot and Oracle introducing AI-driven features [ReportPrime — Top Human Resource Management Market Companies - Rankings, Profiles, SWOT Analysis & Strategic Outlook](https://www.reportprime.com/human-resource-management-r15851/company). This could neutralize Novaworks' "AI-native" advantage over time.
- **New Platform Entrants**: Large technology platforms such as Microsoft and Salesforce are identified as potential future competitors that could enter the HCM space, leveraging their vast enterprise customer bases and technical capabilities \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Platform Dependency**: The venture's reliance on ServiceNow creates a dependency risk. Changes in ServiceNow's strategy, pricing, or platform capabilities could directly impact Novaworks' viability. This is noted as a key issue for analysis in the \[CHAPTER: GTM and Partners\] and is a primary strategic barrier discussed in *Market Entry Barriers & Enablers*.

## Market Entry Barriers & Enablers

The venture's ability to enter the market is defined by a single, powerful enabler—its proposed integration with the ServiceNow ecosystem—which is simultaneously offset by significant customer, regulatory, and strategic barriers. While the ServiceNow partnership provides a potential channel to market, the venture faces high customer switching costs, a complex regulatory landscape for AI in HR, and a fundamental misalignment with Workday's corporate assets.

### Regulatory and Technical Environment

The most significant regulatory barrier is the increasing scrutiny of AI in employment decisions. As noted in the Legal and IP chapter, the product's core function places it in a high-risk category, which will require substantial investment in compliance infrastructure before market entry. Novaworks acknowledges this by planning to build a "Nova HR Codex for Global Compliance," but this is a future objective, and the development itself is a barrier \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 26\].

Technically, the venture's reliance on the ServiceNow platform is both an enabler and a constraint. It provides a standardized development and deployment environment, which may lower the barrier for customers already on the platform. However, this deep integration creates a dependency that could hinder adoption by non-ServiceNow customers and poses a risk if the partnership terms, which are currently informal, change \[CHAPTER: Legal and IP\].

### Customer and Channel Dynamics

Customer adoption presents a formidable barrier. Enterprises are inherently risk-averse when replacing core systems of record like HCM. The venture plans to mitigate this by building on the "proven and secure" ServiceNow platform to gain credibility \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. 24\]. However, this does not eliminate the high costs and operational disruption associated with switching. The venture's own materials identify customer willingness to switch or augment existing systems as a primary assumption that must hold true for the business model to work \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 3\].

The ServiceNow partnership is the venture's designated channel to overcome this inertia. By leveraging co-selling motions and potential SKU bundling, Novaworks aims to use ServiceNow's existing customer relationships as its primary entry point \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 8\]. While this is a clear enabler, its effectiveness is contingent on the formalization of a currently verbal agreement, representing a single point of failure for the entire go-to-market strategy.

### Corporate Assets as Enablers (Workday Perspective)

From the perspective of an internal Workday venture, the current strategy is fundamentally misaligned with Workday's corporate assets. The reliance on ServiceNow actively works against Workday's strategic interests.

However, if the venture were pivoted to build on the Workday platform, several powerful corporate enablers would become available:

- **Distribution Channel:** Workday’s existing global customer base and enterprise sales force would provide a direct and trusted channel to the target CHRO and CIO buyers.
- **Brand Trust:** Leveraging the Workday brand would immediately overcome the credibility and risk-aversion barriers faced by a new startup selling a mission-critical application.
- **Domain Expertise:** Workday’s deep institutional knowledge of global HR compliance, data security, and privacy standards could significantly accelerate product development and de-risk the regulatory challenges.

In its current form, the venture's market entry plan presents more strategic barriers than enablers for Workday. The primary enabler—the ServiceNow partnership—is the source of the primary strategic conflict.

## Market Validation Strategy

To de-risk the investment, a phased validation strategy is required to test the venture's most critical market assumptions before committing to full-scale development and commercialization. The strategy prioritizes direct engagement with target customers to confirm the problem-solution fit, willingness to pay, and the viability of displacing incumbent Human Capital Management (HCM) systems.

### Critical Market Assumptions

The success of Novaworks hinges on three core market assumptions that must be validated. These are ranked in order of importance, as failure at the highest level invalidates subsequent assumptions.

1. **Willingness to Replace or Augment Core HCM:** The most critical assumption is that enterprises, particularly those with significant deskless populations, perceive enough pain with their current HCM systems to either undertake a full replacement or pay a premium for an augmenting solution \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This is especially salient for the stated strategy of a "WorkDay take out," which requires a compelling event to justify high switching costs \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], a barrier highlighted in the *Market Entry Barriers & Enablers* section.
2. **High-Value Demand for AI-Native, Deskless-First HCM:** The venture presumes a strong and urgent market need for an AI-native HCM platform specifically designed for the deskless workforce, which constitutes 80% of the global total \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. While Gartner reports that HR leaders rank AI-related technologies as their top priority, this assumption must be validated specifically for the deskless segment and its unique workflows \[DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. unknown\]. Novaworks claims 70% of mid-market and enterprise HR teams lack integrated, AI-native capabilities, a key assertion to test \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. unknown\].
3. **Value Proposition Supports Premium Pricing:** The financial model relies on achieving an average contract value (ACV) starting at $325,000 for the smallest customer tier \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\]. This assumption requires validation that target customers perceive sufficient ROI—through increased manager efficiency, higher employee productivity, or lower HR technology operating costs—to justify a premium price point relative to established mid-market competitors \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Validation Methods

A three-phase approach will systematically test the critical assumptions using a combination of primary and secondary research.

- **Phase 1: Formal Design Partner Engagement (Current – Q2 2026)**

  - **Activity:** Convert existing "soft-circled" relationships with strategic partners—ServiceNow, Bell Canada, and Ateko—into formal, documented co-design partnerships \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\]. This involves securing executive sponsorship and dedicated resources from each partner to define MVP requirements and success criteria.
  - **Objective:** Validate the core problem-solution fit and test the "replace vs. augment" hypothesis with sophisticated enterprise buyers. This process will use the framework outlined in company documents, moving from a grand vision to partner-driven requirements gathering \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
  - **Information Sources:** Primary feedback from CHRO and CIO-level stakeholders at partner organizations. Leverage existing interview data from prospective customers mentioned in diligence materials \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

- **Phase 2: Paid MVP Pilot Program (Q2 2026 – Q4 2026)**

  - **Activity:** Following the planned May 2026 MVP release, deploy the product with the initial design partners and expand to a target of 7-10 total pilot customers \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The primary goal is to secure paid pilot contracts to confirm economic commitment.
  - **Objective:** Test the willingness to pay and validate the venture's ROI claims. This phase will measure early quantitative and qualitative indicators of value and test the proposed pricing structure.
  - **Information Sources:** Commercial negotiations, pilot contracts, user engagement data, and direct feedback from pilot participants.

- **Phase 3: Broader Market Signal Analysis (Ongoing)**

  - **Activity:** Conduct structured interviews with 20-30 CHROs and CIOs at non-partner companies that fit the target customer profile, with an emphasis on current Workday customers in deskless-heavy industries (e.g., retail, manufacturing, logistics).
  - **Objective:** Assess the scalability of the value proposition beyond friendly early adopters. Specifically probe the perceived pain points with incumbent systems, the appetite for a "Workday takeout," and the influence of the ServiceNow platform dependency on the purchasing decision.
  - **Information Sources:** Primary research from executive interviews, supplemented by ongoing analysis of secondary market data on AI in HR adoption from sources like Gartner \[DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. unknown\].

### Early Indicators and Decision Triggers

Progress will be measured against specific go/no-go criteria tied to the validation phases. These triggers will inform decisions to continue investment, pivot the strategy, or terminate the initiative.

# Competitive Analysis

## Overview

The competitive landscape is dominated by entrenched Human Capital Management (HCM) incumbents like Workday and Oracle, alongside modern challengers such as Rippling and UKG. These competitors solve the problem through comprehensive feature suites, but often with legacy architecture not optimized for deskless workers or native AI. Novaworks' primary corporate advantage is its proposed native integration with the ServiceNow platform, which provides distribution, security, and data fabric benefits that are difficult for external competitors to replicate. This allows Novaworks to lead on platform synergy while playing catch-up on feature breadth. The analysis supports a partnership strategy; investing in Novaworks allows ServiceNow to fill a critical gap—a native Core HR system of record—faster and with more focus than building it internally. The most critical competitive assumption to validate is that ServiceNow customers will prioritize the benefits of a native, AI-driven solution over the mature, comprehensive feature sets of established HCM leaders.

### Key Takeaways

- **Critical Fact 1**: Novaworks' greatest strength—native integration with ServiceNow—is also its greatest existential risk. Strategic moves by ServiceNow, such as its partnership with UKG or the acquisition of Moveworks, could render the venture's value proposition obsolete.
- **Critical Fact 2**: The venture targets a unique and currently uncontested white space: an AI-native, full-suite HCM for the deskless workforce built directly on the Now Platform. No single competitor occupies this specific intersection, creating a clear market opening if executed quickly.

## Risks

- **Platform Preemption**: ServiceNow could develop its own native HCM solution or deepen its partnership with an established player like UKG, directly competing with and marginalizing Novaworks within its own ecosystem.
- **Incumbent Response**: Well-funded incumbents like Workday or Oracle could leverage their vast resources to launch competing AI-driven modules for the deskless workforce, neutralizing Novaworks' differentiation before it can establish a market foothold.
- **Execution on a Borrowed Moat**: The venture's entire defensibility relies on building high switching costs with customers before its "platform moat," which is dependent on ServiceNow's shifting strategy, disappears.
- **Feature Parity Gap**: The core value proposition is unproven. Early customers must be willing to trade the comprehensive, mature feature sets of incumbents for Novaworks' promised benefits of AI and platform integration.

## Next Steps

**Additional Evidence**

- **Formalize ServiceNow Partnership Terms**: Secure a definitive co-sell agreement, technical roadmap alignment, and clear rules of engagement with ServiceNow to de-risk the partnership dependency and clarify Novaworks' role in the ecosystem.

**Derisking Actions**

- **Validate Customer Value Proposition**: Conduct deep interviews with the "soft-circled" design partners (e.g., Bell Canada) to confirm their willingness to trade feature breadth for the specific benefits of an AI-native, platform-integrated solution.
- **Map ServiceNow's Internal Roadmap**: Engage directly with ServiceNow HRSD and platform product leaders to gain clarity on their internal roadmaps for Core HR features, mitigating the risk of future product overlap.
- **Develop Minimum Viable Moat Plan**: Define the specific features, workflows, and integrations for the initial product that will create the highest possible switching costs for the first 10 customers, focusing on deep operational entrenchment.

## Competitive Landscape Overview

The competitive environment for an AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) solution targeting the deskless workforce is composed of three primary groups: established HCM suite providers, modern cloud-native challengers, and specialized point solutions. The landscape is further complicated by the potential entry of large technology platform companies and the ambiguous role of ServiceNow, which serves as both a foundational partner and a potential competitor.

### A. Problem-Defined Framing

This group includes companies that directly solve the core HCM problem, as well as the alternative and manual methods that represent the status quo for many organizations.

#### Direct Competitors

Direct competitors offer full-suite or near-suite HCM solutions. They are segmented into large, established incumbents that Novaworks aims to displace and smaller, modern platforms competing for the same mid-market segment.

## Competitor Capabilities & Traction

The competitive landscape for Human Capital Management (HCM) is dominated by established enterprise players and challenged by modern, mid-market solutions. Novaworks positions itself against both categories by targeting a specific technological and market gap. The primary competitors can be grouped into two tiers: legacy enterprise suite providers, such as Workday and Oracle, and modern, user-experience-focused platforms like HiBob.

Enterprise incumbents Workday and Oracle represent the main "take out" targets for Novaworks, particularly within the existing ServiceNow customer base \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. Workday is the market leader in the U.S. enterprise segment, offering a comprehensive but expensive suite of HCM tools \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. unknown\]. Oracle also holds a significant market share and has developed specific solutions for the deskless workforce, including generative AI features for scheduling and safety [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/deskless-workforce/). The primary weakness of these incumbents, as identified by Novaworks, is that their platforms are not AI-native and can be costly and complex to manage, creating an opportunity for a more agile, platform-integrated solution \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

In the mid-market, companies like HiBob compete with a focus on user experience and culture management for fast-growing companies. While they offer a more modern interface and lower price point than enterprise incumbents, they lack the deep platform integration that Novaworks proposes with ServiceNow and are not built around an AI-native, agentic architecture \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\].

A third category of competitors offers point solutions for the deskless workforce, validating the market need. For example, [CloudApper](https://www.cloudapper.ai/ai-tablet-for-hr/boosting-deskless-workforce-productivity-with-hr-kiosks/) provides AI-powered HR kiosks, and [Udext](https://www.udext.com/blog/communication-strategies-deskless-workers) offers mobile-first communication tools. These solutions address specific pain points but do not offer a comprehensive, end-to-end HCM system of record, which is the gap Novaworks aims to fill.

The primary opportunity for Novaworks lies in the architectural and demographic gaps left by current market players. No single competitor combines an AI-native, agentic architecture with the enterprise-grade distribution and integration power of the ServiceNow platform while maintaining a specific focus on the historically underserved deskless workforce. Incumbents are too slow to adapt their core architecture, and modern challengers lack the platform advantage. This creates a specific opening for a solution like Novaworks to establish a beachhead with ServiceNow customers seeking to modernize their HCM stack and gain a next-generation, AI-powered system.

## Positioning & Differentiation

This section defines Novaworks' unique market positioning and identifies the defensible white space it aims to capture. The analysis evaluates the venture's proposed differentiation against established and emerging competitors.

### A. White Space Analysis

Novaworks targets a specific, weakly defended market segment: AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) for the deskless workforce, built directly on the ServiceNow platform. This positioning seeks to exploit the gaps left by legacy enterprise suite vendors, modern point solutions, and ServiceNow's own product portfolio.

</table>

### B. Feature & Value Curve Matrix

Novaworks' differentiation strategy centers on delivering high value in areas where both legacy and modern competitors are weak: AI-native capabilities and seamless ServiceNow integration, specifically for deskless workers. This comes at the expense of initial feature breadth, where incumbents like Workday remain superior.

*Scoring: 1 (Low Performance) to 5 (High Performance)*

Novaworks' value proposition is highly differentiated on three key axes:

1. **Platform Integration:** By building *on* ServiceNow, Novaworks offers a level of integration and data unification that third-party systems like Workday or Rippling cannot match. This is a critical advantage for enterprises invested in the ServiceNow ecosystem.
2. **AI-Native Architecture:** The venture's core design is based on agentic AI, which aligns with market demand for emerging HR technologies \[DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. unknown\]. This contrasts with incumbents that are retrofitting AI onto legacy platforms.
3. **Deskless User Experience:** A dedicated focus on the deskless worker promises a superior, mobile-first experience compared to the desktop-centric design of many traditional HCMs \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

The primary trade-off and near-term risk is the initial lack of a comprehensive feature set. The product roadmap projects reaching parity over five years \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\], but early sales cycles will depend on customers prioritizing the benefits of platform integration and AI over the breadth of a mature suite like [Workday, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workday%2C_Inc.).

## Barriers to Entry & Moats

The Human Capital Management (HCM) market is mature, with significant barriers to entry erected by established incumbents. These players have built strong moats primarily through scale, brand recognition, and high customer switching costs associated with deeply embedded systems of record. For a new entrant like Novaworks, disrupting this landscape requires creating new, defensible advantages, as traditional moats are unavailable at the outset. The primary opportunity for disruption lies in leveraging AI to create new forms of value that incumbents are slow to adopt, while the primary defensibility strategy for Novaworks hinges on its exclusive integration with the ServiceNow platform.

### Moat Analysis Grid

The competitive landscape features incumbents with formidable, traditional moats and newer entrants with more nascent, niche-based defenses.

**Incumbent Moats:** Workday and UKG demonstrate strong overall moats built on decades of market presence. Workday's defensibility comes from its position as an integrated financial and HR system of record for large enterprises, creating extremely high switching costs \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 28\], [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workday%2C_Inc.). Its brand and scale are significant barriers for new entrants. UKG has a similar strong moat, with a particular focus on workforce management for deskless and frontline workers, giving it a deep data set and high switching costs within its target verticals [UKG](https://www.ukg.com). Its recent collaboration with ServiceNow to integrate AI solutions poses a direct threat to Novaworks' core value proposition of being the premier AI-HCM on the Now platform [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250506693176/en/ServiceNow-and-UKG-Collaborate-to-Supercharge-Employee-Productivity-and-Efficiency-With-Agentic-AI/).

**Challenger Moats:** Newer competitors possess weaker moats. HiBob competes with a modern user interface but has moderate switching costs and limited scale or brand recognition compared to incumbents \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 28\]. AI-native players like Leena AI have a potential data and IP moat within the niche of conversational AI but lack the broader platform defensibility needed to protect against larger players incorporating similar features [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leena_AI). Deskless-focused apps like Connecteam create moderate switching costs through operational entrenchment but lack significant brand, scale, or data advantages.

### Our Potential Moats

Novaworks is pre-product and currently has no moat. Its strategy is to build defensibility by deeply embedding its AI-native HCM into the ServiceNow ecosystem, creating high switching costs as its primary defense.

Novaworks' most significant—and perhaps only—near-term defensible advantage is its strategic alignment and native integration with ServiceNow. This "platform moat" provides privileged access to distribution, a trusted enterprise platform, and a shared customer base. However, this is also a key vulnerability, as highlighted in the *Risk of Displacement or Obsolescence* section. The moat is borrowed, not owned. ServiceNow's strategic decisions, such as its partnership with UKG or its acquisition of Moveworks, could either strengthen or completely undermine Novaworks' position [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250506693176/en/ServiceNow-and-UKG-Collaborate-to-Supercharge-Employee-Productivity-and-Efficiency-With-Agentic-AI/), [ServiceNow](https://newsroom.servicenow.com/press-releases/details/2025/ServiceNow-to-extend-leading-agentic-AI-to-every-employee-for-every-corner-of-the-business-with-acquisition-of-Moveworks-03-10-2025-traffic/default.aspx). The long-term durability of Novaworks' business depends entirely on its ability to convert this initial platform advantage into high, customer-owned switching costs before the strategic landscape shifts.

## Risk of Displacement or Obsolescence

The primary risks to Novaworks are platform dependency, preemption by its key partner ServiceNow, and a reactive strategy by entrenched Human Capital Management (HCM) incumbents. While Novaworks targets a clear market gap with an AI-native approach for deskless workers \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], its pre-product status makes it highly vulnerable to strategic moves by established and well-funded competitors who are also aggressively pursuing AI capabilities.

### Threat Matrix

The most significant threats are not from direct competitors matching Novaworks' proposed features, but from strategic platform and M&A activities that could render Novaworks' entire value proposition obsolete or redundant before it reaches the market.

### Head-to-Head Risk Assessment

Novaworks is entering a market where its primary theoretical advantages—being AI-native and built on ServiceNow—are directly challenged by the platform owner's strategic moves and the immense scale of incumbents. As a pre-product entity, it currently loses on every critical dimension except for its focused, unencumbered vision.

## Claims

 1. Novaworks' primary "take out" targets are established HCM incumbents like Workday, Oracle, and SAP.
 2. The venture's core differentiation is its AI-native architecture, native integration on the ServiceNow platform, and specific focus on the deskless workforce.
 3. ServiceNow's acquisition of Moveworks and partnership with UKG represent a significant threat to Novaworks' position in the ecosystem.
 4. The most significant barrier to adoption for Novaworks' target customers is organizational inertia and reliance on manual processes or legacy systems.
 5. Novaworks' most viable long-term moat is creating high customer switching costs by becoming the embedded HCM system of record on the Now Platform.
 6. The company plans to use publicly available LLMs and open-source toolkits, meaning its defensibility will not come from core technology patents.
 7. The product roadmap projects reaching feature parity with incumbents over a five-year period.
 8. Novaworks is pre-product and pre-revenue, seeking a $7M-$10M seed round.
 9. The deskless workforce, representing 80% of global employees, is historically underserved by traditional HCM systems.
10. The venture's success is entirely dependent on a yet-to-be-finalized co-sell agreement and partnership with ServiceNow.

# GTM and Partners

## Overview

Novaworks' go-to-market strategy targets mid-market organizations within the ServiceNow ecosystem that have a large, underserved deskless workforce. The initial entry point leverages existing ServiceNow Employee Center Pro customers, capitalizing on their platform investment to reduce adoption friction. Success is critically dependent on formalizing a cornerstone partnership with ServiceNow for platform access, co-selling, and IP licensing, alongside securing "Customer Zero" implementation partners like Bell Canada. The company's primary market entry advantage is its ability to offer an AI-native solution on ServiceNow's trusted and secure platform. Validation will be achieved through a 15-month plan to convert these initial partners into 3-5 paid pilots, with success measured by contract value, user engagement, and conversion to full-term agreements.

### Key Takeaways

- **Critical Partnership Dependency**: The entire go-to-market strategy is contingent on formalizing a multi-faceted partnership with ServiceNow for platform access, co-selling, and IP licensing; failure to execute this agreement would invalidate the business model.
- **Validation Through Paid Pilots**: Market validation hinges on converting "Customer Zero" partners, specifically ServiceNow and Bell Canada, into 3-5 paid pilots with an average annual contract value over $150,000 within the 15-month seed funding runway.

## Risks

- **Partnership Concentration**: The venture's viability is a single point of failure dependent on the successful negotiation and execution of the proposed ServiceNow partnership, which is currently based on verbal agreements for key components like IP licensing.
- **Sales Cycle Complexity**: A long 6-9 month sales cycle requiring alignment between two distinct executive buyers, the CHRO and CIO, creates a high risk of deals stalling or failing to close if both stakeholders' priorities are not met.
- **Channel Dependency**: An over-reliance on ServiceNow's sales channels for customer acquisition cedes significant control over lead generation, sales execution, and revenue predictability to a third party whose priorities may not always align with Novaworks'.
- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: The company is entering a market with emerging and complex regulations for AI in HR, which could require unforeseen and costly product changes, potentially delaying the roadmap and increasing compliance overhead.

## Next Steps

**Additional Evidence**

- **Partnership Agreement Status**: Obtain a draft or term sheet of the proposed ServiceNow partnership agreement to validate the current status, key terms, and timeline for formalizing the "verbal agreement" on IP licensing and co-selling.
- **Customer Zero Commitment**: Secure non-binding Letters of Intent (LOIs) from proposed "Customer Zero" partners, Bell Canada and Ateko, to provide tangible evidence of their commitment to a paid pilot program post-MVP.

**Derisking Actions**

- **Formalize ServiceNow Terms**: Prioritize negotiating and signing a definitive, multi-year partnership agreement with ServiceNow, focusing on codifying co-sell incentives, IP rights, and the process for creating a bundled SKU. This directly addresses the **Partnership Concentration** risk.
- **Develop Dual-Persona Value Proposition**: Create distinct sales collateral and ROI models tailored for the CHRO (focusing on business outcomes like retention) and the CIO (focusing on platform consolidation and security) to streamline the **Sales Cycle Complexity**.
- **Initiate Direct Pipeline Generation**: Task the founders with building a small, direct pipeline of 10-15 target customers within the ServiceNow ecosystem to test sales messaging and reduce **Channel Dependency** in the initial phase.
- **Conduct AI Compliance Audit**: Engage a third-party expert to audit the planned AI features against current and pending regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, NYC Local Law 144) to create a proactive compliance roadmap, mitigating **Regulatory Uncertainty**.

## Target Customer Definition & Entry Strategy

Novaworks' entry strategy targets a large, historically underserved market segment—the deskless workforce—by leveraging a highly specific initial customer profile within the ServiceNow ecosystem. The approach prioritizes rapid validation through strategic "Customer Zero" partnerships before scaling to the broader market.

### Initial Target Customer: The Underserved Deskless Workforce

Novaworks identifies its primary target market as the global "deskless" workforce, which constitutes approximately 80% of the total global workforce, or three billion people \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 5\], \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A55Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A55Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=1Uu3B3hO87DcBn1Msu80goq35vPp7OZmc3ELhpalAbI%3D), p. 1\]. This segment, prevalent in industries such as retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, has been historically neglected by traditional Human Capital Management (HCM) systems [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/facing-deskless-labor-shortage-with-technology), [The Human Capital Hub](https://www.thehumancapitalhub.com/articles/deskless-workers-what-you-need-to-know).

This workforce faces distinct operational challenges that create an acute need for a specialized solution:

- **High Employee Turnover:** Organizations with many deskless workers report difficulty in retaining talent, with employees more likely to change jobs than their corporate counterparts [The Human Capital Hub](https://www.thehumancapitalhub.com/articles/deskless-workers-what-you-need-to-know).
- **Communication Gaps:** Deskless workers often lack access to real-time communication tools, leading to missed information and operational inefficiencies [Indeavor](https://www.indeavor.com/blog/challenges-of-deskless-workers/).
- **Training and Development Hurdles:** Irregular schedules and lack of dedicated hardware make it difficult to deliver necessary training, impacting job performance and career growth [Simpplr](https://www.simpplr.com/blog/2023/challenges-training-deskless-workers/).

### Entry Point Logic and Customer Prioritization

Novaworks employs a phased entry strategy designed to minimize risk and accelerate market validation. The initial focus is on a narrow, high-potential customer segment before expanding into adjacent verticals.

**Ideal Customer Profile:** The initial target is mid-market organizations with up to 7,500 employees that meet specific criteria:

- They are existing users of ServiceNow's Employee Center (EC) Pro or Employee Service Foundations products.
- They are approaching a renewal decision for their current core HCM system.
- They have an executive-level focus on implementing AI and Generative AI for HR functions \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 14\].

This "land-and-expand" approach within the ServiceNow ecosystem is logical, as it targets customers already invested in the platform, thereby reducing technical and commercial friction.

**Phased Vertical Rollout:** The company plans a sequential entry into specific industries with large deskless populations. The capability roadmap prioritizes Transportation and Retail in Year 1, followed by Telecommunications in Year 2, and Manufacturing and Healthcare in Year 3 \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 8\].

**"Customer Zero" Validation:** The core of the entry strategy is to secure initial "design partners" to act as proof points. Novaworks has identified ServiceNow itself, along with Bell Canada and its subsidiary Ateko, as "Customer Zero" partners \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 11, 14\], \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A55Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A55Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=1Uu3B3hO87DcBn1Msu80goq35vPp7OZmc3ELhpalAbI%3D), p. 7\]. These partnerships are intended to provide critical early feedback and credible use cases to attract subsequent customers.

### Value Proposition Fit and Decision Process

Novaworks' value proposition directly addresses the identified pain points of its target customers. The decision-making process for adopting such a system typically involves both HR and IT leadership over a 6-to-9-month sales cycle \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A55Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A55Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=1Uu3B3hO87DcBn1Msu80goq35vPp7OZmc3ELhpalAbI%3D), p. 27\].

</table>

The buying decision is made at the executive level, primarily by the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or platform owner \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. 27\]. The sales process involves a pre-sales qualification, a business value assessment (BVA), a proposal, a proof-of-concept (POC), and then full implementation \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 27\].

### Required Proof Points for Adoption

To convince initial customers, Novaworks must provide specific evidence to de-risk the adoption of a new platform from an early-stage company.

- **Successful "Customer Zero" Implementations:** The most critical proof point will be the successful deployment and endorsement from ServiceNow and Bell Canada. These references are positioned as the "beachhead" to validate the model and enable a credible "WorkDay take out" strategy for larger enterprise customers \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 29\].
- **Platform Security and Stability:** Prospects' concerns about engaging with a startup will be addressed by emphasizing that the solution is built on the "proven and secure" ServiceNow platform, which provides enterprise-grade stability and integration capabilities \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 26\].
- **Quantifiable Return on Investment (ROI):** The pre-sales motion includes a business value assessment to demonstrate tangible ROI, a necessary step to secure budget from both the CHRO and CIO \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 27\].
- **Compliance and Risk Mitigation:** Given the growing regulatory scrutiny of AI in HR, customers will likely require evidence of compliance with laws such as NYC's Local Law 144 and the EU AI Act [Capstone DC](https://capstonedc.com/insights/growing-regulatory-risks-for-ai-driven-human-capital-management-platforms/). While detailed analysis of this is outside the scope of this chapter, it represents a key purchasing consideration.

## Partnership Strategy & Requirements

Novaworks' go-to-market model is fundamentally dependent on a multi-layered partnership strategy to address critical gaps in platform technology, market access, and product completeness. The venture cannot succeed as a standalone entity and requires deep, formalized relationships with specific strategic partners to acquire customers and deliver a viable solution. The success of this strategy hinges almost entirely on formalizing a proposed cornerstone partnership with ServiceNow.

### Partnership Gaps and Strategic Rationale

Novaworks is a pre-product company and has identified three primary areas where partnerships are essential for execution:

1. **Platform & Technology Access:** The entire product is designed to be built on the ServiceNow platform. This dependency requires a partnership that provides not only technical access and support but also credibility and security assurances for enterprise customers \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
2. **Market & Channel Access:** The company plans to bypass the high cost and long lead times of building a direct sales force by using the sales channels of its strategic partners. The primary GTM approach targets existing ServiceNow customers, making a co-sell or reseller partnership the main vehicle for customer acquisition \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 11\], \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
3. **Product Capability Extension:** The initial product focuses on AI-native core HR and agentic workflows, intentionally omitting functions like payroll and benefits administration. Partnerships with established providers in these areas are necessary to offer a comprehensive HCM solution that can compete with incumbents \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Critical Market Access & Platform Partnerships

Novaworks has identified two initial partners that are central to its launch and early growth. These relationships provide the foundation for both the product and its route to market.

- **ServiceNow:** This is the cornerstone partnership upon which the entire business model is built. The relationship is multifaceted, serving as a technology platform, a primary sales channel, and a key initial customer. Novaworks states that a critical assumption for its business model is that a ServiceNow partnership is signed with co-sell and co-market opportunities \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The proposed partnership includes developing a combined Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) (e.g., EC Pro Plus + Nova HCM) and positioning ServiceNow as an enterprise "customer zero" \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 14\]. A verbal agreement is also in place for Novaworks to use ServiceNow's Skills Intelligence IP via a non-exclusive license, which requires sharing back any modifications \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Ateko (backed by Bell Canada):** Ateko is positioned as another "customer zero" and a key GTM and services partner \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This relationship provides early product validation with a significant enterprise, a referenceable case study, and an implementation partner to handle customer deployments. Bell Canada's involvement provides access to a large, complex organization with a significant deskless workforce, aligning directly with Novaworks' target market.

### Capability & Ecosystem Partnerships

To deliver a complete HCM suite, Novaworks must integrate with providers of specialized HR functions. These partnerships are crucial for filling product gaps and ensuring the solution meets enterprise buyers' expectations.

- **Payroll and Benefits Providers:** Novaworks is in discussions with **SequoiaOne** for benefits and payroll integration \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The company also identifies **ADP**, **JustWorks**, and **Deel** as ideal future partners to provide comprehensive payroll and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) services. These integrations are necessary to compete with all-in-one solutions from incumbents like Workday and SAP.

### Partnership Models and Value Exchange

Novaworks plans to use distinct partnership models tailored to each partner's role in the ecosystem. The value exchange is designed to create mutual benefit by driving platform adoption for ServiceNow and providing Novaworks with essential technology and market access.

</table>

### Risks and Dependencies

The partnership strategy carries a high degree of concentration risk. The venture's viability is almost entirely dependent on successfully negotiating and executing the proposed partnership with ServiceNow.

- **Single Point of Failure:** The ServiceNow partnership is presented as a core assumption, not a finalized agreement \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The IP licensing component is based on a "verbal agreement" \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. Failure to formalize this relationship on favorable terms would invalidate the company's entire GTM and product strategy.
- **Execution and Negotiation Risk:** As a pre-product startup, Novaworks has limited leverage in negotiations with a large corporation like ServiceNow. Finalizing terms for revenue sharing, SKU bundling, IP rights, and co-selling incentives will be complex and time-consuming.
- **Channel Dependency:** Over-reliance on partners for sales creates a dependency on their priorities, sales cycles, and incentive structures. Novaworks will have limited direct control over lead generation and the sales process, which could impact revenue predictability.

## Go-to-Market Execution Plan

Novaworks' go-to-market (GTM) execution plan is a phased, multi-channel strategy centered on leveraging a strategic partnership with ServiceNow to penetrate the mid-enterprise market. The plan begins with founder-led sales to secure initial design partners before scaling through a co-sell motion. The execution of this entire plan is contingent upon the formalization of the proposed ServiceNow partnership, which is a critical dependency noted in the \[CHAPTER: Revenue Model\].

### Phased Launch Sequence and Milestones

The company has outlined a three-phase launch sequence to move from pre-product to initial market traction over approximately nine months \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This approach prioritizes product validation with key partners before a broader public launch.

### Go-to-Market Channels and Sales Process

Novaworks plans a hybrid GTM approach that combines direct, founder-led sales with a partner-centric channel strategy \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The initial customer acquisition will be driven by the founders, targeting their existing C-level relationships and ServiceNow customers who are underpenetrated with HRSD products \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*, p. unknown\].

The primary scaling channel will be a co-sell motion with ServiceNow (as detailed in the Partnership Strategy & Requirements section), supplemented by partnerships with Ateko and Sequoia \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The long-term strategy includes developing a combined SKU with ServiceNow and exploring OEM opportunities \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*, p. unknown\], \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

The sales process is designed for a 6-9 month cycle, targeting the CHRO and CIO as the primary decision-makers \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The defined stages are:

1. Pre-Sales Qualification (SQL)
2. Business Value Assessment (BVA)
3. Proposal
4. Proof of Concept (POC)
5. Full Implementation
6. Upsell and Renewal

### Pricing Strategy for Market Entry

The company will enter the market with a premium pricing strategy intended to validate customer willingness-to-pay for an AI-native HCM solution. The model is a hybrid of a base platform fee and per-user, usage-based charges \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. As detailed in the \[CHAPTER: Revenue Model\], target annual contract values (ACVs) begin at $325,000 for mid-enterprise customers (5,000 FTEs) \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*, p. unknown\]. This positions Novaworks above mid-market solutions but below established enterprise vendors like Workday, aiming to capture value based on its integrated platform and AI capabilities \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\]. The initial sales to design partners will be critical for testing this price point.

### Resource Requirements and Allocation

The GTM execution will initially be lean and founder-led. CEO Kelley Steven-Waiss will act as the initial Chief Sales Officer, and Stanimira Koleva will lead global GTM and partnerships \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The founding team will handle initial sales without commission-based compensation \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

The requested $7M seed funding is allocated to support a 15-month runway, covering product development, market launch, and establishing the GTM foundation \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\]. The financial plan allocates 44% of the Year 1 FTE expense ($4.1M total) to Sales & G&A, increasing to 52% of the Year 2 FTE expense ($5.8M total) as the company shifts focus from R&D to commercial scaling \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\]. A formal, commission-based sales compensation structure will be implemented as the company scales beyond founder-led sales \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

## Stakeholder Engagement & Regulatory Navigation

Successful market entry for Novaworks depends on navigating a complex ecosystem of strategic partners, enterprise buyers, and an evolving regulatory landscape for AI in human capital management (HCM). The company's strategy relies heavily on leveraging key relationships to secure initial customers and manage compliance proactively.

### Stakeholder Mapping and Influence Analysis

Novaworks' success is contingent upon securing buy-in from a concentrated group of high-influence stakeholders. The company's reliance on the ServiceNow ecosystem for both technology and distribution elevates the importance of this partnership, while the dual CHRO and CIO buyer personas within target customers create a complex sales environment.

### Key Stakeholder Engagement Plan

A sequenced engagement plan targeting the most critical stakeholders is necessary to build momentum and mitigate adoption risk.

1. **ServiceNow:** The primary objective is to formalize the planned co-sell and co-market partnership outlined in diligence documents \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The engagement strategy involves leveraging the founders' existing relationships and aligning Novaworks' value proposition with ServiceNow's strategic goals, such as displacing Workday and expanding its platform-of-platforms vision \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. unknown\]. Securing official "customer zero" status for ServiceNow's internal use is a critical validation milestone.
2. **Bell Canada / Ateko:** The objective is to ensure a successful "customer zero" implementation that can be developed into a powerful case study. The engagement will be a deep, co-design partnership, providing them with high-touch support to guarantee the product meets their needs and delivers quantifiable business value.
3. **Target Customer CHROs:** Initial engagement will be led by the founders, using their domain expertise and the CHRO Advisory Board's network to secure early meetings \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\]. The strategy is to lead with a consultative, ROI-driven approach that demonstrates a clear path to solving key business problems like deskless worker retention and manager productivity.
4. **Target Customer CIOs:** Engagement must run parallel to CHRO outreach. The strategy is to emphasize the benefits of building on a trusted, secure, and existing platform (ServiceNow), which reduces technical risk, simplifies integration, and supports platform consolidation goals \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
5. **CHRO Advisory Board:** The objective is to leverage this group for product validation and warm introductions to prospective customers. Engagement will involve structured quarterly meetings to review the product roadmap and solicit feedback on GTM messaging, ensuring the product remains aligned with buyer needs.

### Regulatory and Compliance Navigation

Novaworks enters an HCM market with established labor laws and emerging regulations specific to AI. Proactive compliance is a core part of its strategy.

- **AI and Algorithmic Bias:** AI-driven HCM platforms face increasing scrutiny over data privacy, bias mitigation, and transparency [Capstone DC](https://capstonedc.com/insights/growing-regulatory-risks-for-ai-driven-human-capital-management-platforms/). Novaworks must ensure its AI models comply with guidelines from bodies like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to prevent discriminatory practices in hiring and talent management.
- **Labor Law Compliance:** The platform must adhere to established U.S. labor laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
- **Data Security and Privacy:** To win enterprise customers, achieving certifications such as SOC 2 Type II will be a requirement to demonstrate sufficient data security and privacy controls [AICPA](https://www.aicpa.org/).

Novaworks' plan to build a "Nova HR Codex for Global Compliance" is a strategic asset designed to address these requirements proactively \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. Furthermore, building on the ServiceNow platform provides a significant advantage, as it offers a secure, private, and compliant foundation that already has the trust of enterprise CIOs \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Several stakeholder and regulatory risks could impede market entry if not actively managed.

- **Partnership Dependency Risk:** The business model is critically dependent on a successful partnership with ServiceNow for co-selling and marketing \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. A failure to execute this partnership would severely limit lead generation and sales velocity.
  - **Mitigation:** Prioritize formalizing a multi-year partnership agreement with clear rules of engagement, mutual commitments, and incentives for ServiceNow's sales team.
- **Complex Sales Cycle Risk:** Selling to both the CHRO and the CIO creates a long sales cycle (estimated at 6-9 months) with a high risk of stalling if the two personas are not aligned \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
  - **Mitigation:** Develop a dual-threaded value proposition that addresses the CHRO’s business outcomes and the CIO’s technical and platform strategy objectives. The sales process must secure champions in both functions early.
- **Regulatory Headwinds Risk:** New, unforeseen regulations governing AI in HR could require significant product changes, delaying the roadmap and increasing R&D costs.
  - **Mitigation:** Continue to use the CHRO Advisory Board to anticipate regulatory trends. Design the "Nova HR Codex" with a modular architecture that can be updated to reflect new compliance requirements without re-engineering the entire platform.

## Market Validation Metrics & Timeline

The market validation plan for Novaworks is structured to systematically test the venture's most critical assumptions within the 15-month runway provided by the seed funding \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 15\]. As a pre-product company, the primary objective is to move from concept to tangible evidence of problem-solution fit and customer willingness-to-pay before committing to a full-scale go-to-market expansion. The validation process is centered on securing and executing paid pilot programs with the initial design partners: ServiceNow, Bell Canada, and Ateko \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 9\].

### Learning Objectives & Key Assumptions

The initial go-to-market phase must validate four foundational assumptions that underpin the entire business model. The most critical of these, as noted in the \[CHAPTER: Revenue Model\], is confirming that customers will pay a premium for an unproven solution.

1. **Willingness-to-Pay:** The central hypothesis to be tested is whether enterprises will commit to paid pilots at a meaningful contract value, providing a validation path toward the target Tier 1 annual contract value (ACV) of $325,000 \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 12\].
2. **Problem-Solution Fit:** The validation process must confirm that the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) effectively addresses high-priority operational and employee experience challenges for the deskless workforce, a segment comprising 80% of the global workforce [The Human Capital Hub](https://www.thehumancapitalhub.com/articles/deskless-workers-what-you-need-to-know).
3. **Platform Stickiness:** A key assumption is that the AI-native value proposition is compelling enough for customers to either replace an existing Human Capital Management (HCM) system or bear the cost and complexity of running Novaworks alongside their current solution \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 3\].
4. **Sales Cycle Viability:** The plan must test the feasibility of the projected 6-9 month sales cycle for initial customers, from first contact to a signed pilot agreement \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 30\].

### Market Validation Metrics

Success will be measured using a combination of leading indicators (engagement and commitment) and lagging indicators (satisfaction and conversion). These metrics are designed to provide clear, quantifiable evidence of market acceptance before a Series A funding round is considered \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 20\].

### Validation Timeline and Decision Gates

The validation timeline is aligned with key product milestones and establishes clear decision points for resource allocation and strategic adjustments.

- **Phase 1: Product Finalization & Initial Engagement (Q4 2025 – Q1 2026)**

  - **Milestone:** Deliver a limited MVP for the ServiceNow partner kickoff event in January 2026 \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A55Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A55Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=1Uu3B3hO87DcBn1Msu80goq35vPp7OZmc3ELhpalAbI%3D), p. 13\].
  - **Validation Goal:** Secure non-binding Letters of Intent (LOIs) from at least three design partners (ServiceNow, Bell, Ateko) for paid pilots.

- **Phase 2: MVP Launch & Pilot Conversion (Q2 2026)**

  - **Milestone:** Launch the full MVP and exit stealth mode at the ServiceNow Knowledge event in May 2026 \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A55Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A55Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=1Uu3B3hO87DcBn1Msu80goq35vPp7OZmc3ELhpalAbI%3D), p. 14\].
  - **Validation Goal:** Convert LOIs into 3-5 signed, paid pilot agreements by the end of June 2026.
  - **Decision Gate 1 (End of June 2026):** A formal Go/No-Go decision will be made on deploying resources for pilot implementations. Proceeding requires securing at least two paid pilot contracts.

- **Phase 3: Pilot Execution & Monitoring (Q3 – Q4 2026)**

  - **Validation Goal:** Deploy the solution with pilot customers and actively monitor user engagement (MAU) and satisfaction (NPS). Initiate discussions for conversion to full-term contracts.

- **Phase 4: Scale Decision (Q1 2027)**

  - **Decision Gate 2 (End of Q1 2027):** Evaluate overall pilot performance against the defined metrics. A Go/No-Go decision will be made on scaling the GTM team and proceeding with a Series A fundraise.

### Pivot Triggers and Scaling Criteria

Clear criteria are established to guide decisions on whether to pivot the strategy or scale the operation.

**Pivot Triggers**:A strategic pivot—potentially involving a significant change to the product, pricing model, or target market—will be triggered if the company observes one or more of the following by the established decision gates:

- Failure to secure at least two paid pilot agreements by the end of Q2 2026.
- Average pilot ACV is consistently below 50% of the target ($75,000), indicating a severe misalignment on pricing and perceived value.
- Pilot MAU remains below 20% after three months of deployment, signaling poor product-market fit or user experience issues.

**Scaling Criteria**:A decision to scale operations, including hiring a dedicated sales team and pursuing a Series A round, will be contingent upon meeting the following criteria by the end of Q1 2027:

- Successful execution of at least three paid pilots with an average ACV exceeding $150,000.
- Achievement of MAU greater than 40% and an NPS score above 30 in at least two of the pilot accounts.
- Conversion of at least one pilot customer to a full multi-year contract at or near the target Tier 1 ACV.

# Revenue Model

## Overview

Novaworks creates value by offering a specialized, AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) platform for the deskless workforce, built on ServiceNow. It captures this value through a premium-priced, hybrid subscription model with tiered annual contract values (ACVs) starting at $325,000. The primary leverage comes from the planned partnership with ServiceNow, which provides access to an established customer base, sales channels, and the potential for a bundled product offering. Evidence supporting the revenue assumptions is currently limited to commitments from three "customer zero" design partners and alignment with market trends toward AI adoption, but lacks real-world pricing validation. The most critical assumption to validate is that customers will pay the proposed premium price for a new solution, which can be tested by converting initial design partners into paid pilots with material financial commitment.

### Key Takeaways

- **Premium Pricing Hypothesis**: The entire revenue model hinges on validating a premium price point ($325k+ ACV) for a new entrant, positioning it significantly above established mid-market players. Success depends entirely on proving superior value through AI and ServiceNow integration to justify this cost.
- **Extreme Go-to-Market Dependency**: The unit economics, particularly the projected LTV/CAC ratios reaching over 100x, are exceptionally optimistic and rely almost entirely on the successful execution of a co-sell partnership with ServiceNow. Failure to activate this channel effectively would invalidate the financial model.

## Risks

- **Price Point Rejection**: The target ACV of $325,000 for the entry-level tier is ambitious for a new market entrant and may be rejected by customers in favor of lower-cost, established alternatives, especially without a proven track record of ROI.
- **Unrealistic CAC Projections**: The projected Customer Acquisition Costs are extremely low, leading to LTV/CAC ratios (75x-105x) that are far outside industry norms. These figures are based on an unproven and unfinalized co-sell partnership with ServiceNow, making the unit economics highly speculative.
- **Inconsistent Financial Modeling**: The presentation contains conflicting data for the projected 2028 gross margin (79.2% vs. 69%), which undermines confidence in the overall financial projections and modeling discipline.
- **Channel Dependency**: The revenue model is critically dependent on a successful co-sell and bundling partnership with ServiceNow. Any delays, changes in terms, or poor execution of this partnership would severely impact the ability to achieve revenue targets and the aggressive CAC assumptions.

## Next Steps

**Additional Evidence**

- **Reconciled Financial Model**: Request a revised financial model that resolves the conflicting gross margin projections and provides detailed, bottom-up assumptions for the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) calculations.
- **Partnership Term Sheet**: Obtain a draft or term sheet of the proposed co-sell and bundling agreement with ServiceNow to assess the commercial terms, revenue share, and level of commitment from both parties.

**Derisking Actions**

- **Paid Pilot Conversion**: Secure paid pilot agreements from at least two of the three "customer zero" partners (ServiceNow, Bell Canada, Ateko) at 25-40% of the target ACV by Q2 2026 to validate initial willingness-to-pay.
- **Price Elasticity Testing**: Present multi-tiered pilot offers (e.g., Core Suite, Agentic Module only, Usage-Based) to the next cohort of 7-10 design partners to gather data on price sensitivity and which features most effectively drive value.
- **Channel Validation via LOIs**: Secure at least three non-binding Letters of Intent (LOIs) from qualified ServiceNow customers, co-sourced with the ServiceNow sales team, that specify pricing terms for a future pilot contingent on MVP delivery.
- **LLM Cost Modeling**: Develop a detailed cost model for third-party LLM consumption based on projected usage per customer, and stress-test the gross margin projections against potential increases in these variable costs.

## Value Creation & Monetization Strategy

Novaworks' value creation and monetization strategy centers on delivering a specialized, AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) solution for the deskless workforce, monetized through a hybrid subscription model that leverages deep integration with the ServiceNow ecosystem. The strategy links specific, quantifiable business outcomes to a tiered pricing structure, creating a clear path from value delivery to revenue generation.

### Value Proposition and Payment Justification

The core value proposition is an AI-native HCM platform built on ServiceNow, designed to address the historically underserved deskless worker segment \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A40%3A26Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A40%3A26Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=V%2B9oKFXVl0CnOoLd%2FdeKAIaEHle%2FJjX0%2B7h3mbdEvtY%3D), p. unknown\]. The justification for customer payment is based on three primary outcomes:

1. **Increased Operational Efficiency:** The platform aims to expand managers' span of control through HR automation, allowing organizations to "do more with less" \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\], \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A40%3A26Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A40%3A26Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=V%2B9oKFXVl0CnOoLd%2FdeKAIaEHle%2FJjX0%2B7h3mbdEvtY%3D), p. unknown\].
2. **Improved Employee Experience:** It seeks to enhance loyalty and productivity among frontline employees by providing hyper-personalized tools and interactions \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A40%3A26Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A40%3A26Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=V%2B9oKFXVl0CnOoLd%2FdeKAIaEHle%2FJjX0%2B7h3mbdEvtY%3D), p. unknown\].
3. **Reduced IT Complexity:** By centralizing HCM on the ServiceNow platform, Novaworks offers IT departments a simplified, familiar environment, creating economies of scale and lowering the total cost of the HR technology stack \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A40%3A26Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A40%3A26Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=V%2B9oKFXVl0CnOoLd%2FdeKAIaEHle%2FJjX0%2B7h3mbdEvtY%3D), p. unknown\], \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\].

### Monetization Model and Pricing Structure

Novaworks plans to use a hybrid monetization model that combines a recurring base subscription fee with variable, usage-based charges \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A40%3A26Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A40%3A26Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=V%2B9oKFXVl0CnOoLd%2FdeKAIaEHle%2FJjX0%2B7h3mbdEvtY%3D), p. unknown\]. This approach is common in the software industry as it provides a stable revenue foundation while aligning customer costs with the value they receive from the product [Stripe — Hybrid pricing models for businesses](https://stripe.com/resources/more/hybrid-pricing-models?utm_source=openai).

The pricing structure is tiered based on customer size, measured by the number of full-time employees (FTEs). This structure is designed to scale with the customer's organization \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\]. The company also intends to offer volume discounts for customers who commit to prepaid contracts, incentivizing larger and longer-term agreements \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A40%3A26Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A40%3A26Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=V%2B9oKFXVl0CnOoLd%2FdeKAIaEHle%2FJjX0%2B7h3mbdEvtY%3D), p. unknown\].

| Customer Tier (by Employee Count) | Description | Target Annual Contract Value (ACV) | \*\*| :--- | :--- | :--- | \*\*| Tier 1 | Organizations with fewer than 5,000 FTEs | $325,000 | \*\*| Tier 2 | Organizations with 5,000 to 20,000 FTEs | $620,000 | \*\*| Tier 3 | Organizations with over 20,000 FTEs | $1,750,000 | ***Source: \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\]***

### Revenue Streams

The company has identified a primary revenue stream and planned secondary streams to support long-term growth.

- **Primary Revenue Stream:** The main source of revenue will be recurring subscription fees from the core AI-native HCM platform, sold based on the tiered structure detailed above \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\].
- **Secondary Revenue Streams:** Future revenue growth is expected from the upsell of additional modules, such as advanced talent management and workforce management capabilities, which are planned for release in years two and three of the product roadmap \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\]. The company also anticipates a smaller revenue stream from professional services for custom implementation work required by large enterprise clients \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Corporate Synergies Enhancing Monetization

The monetization strategy is significantly enhanced by its symbiotic relationship with ServiceNow. This synergy provides pricing power and market access advantages that a standalone startup would lack.

- **Product Bundling:** A key synergy is the plan for "bundling" Novaworks' SKU with ServiceNow products like EC Pro, creating a combined offering that can be sold directly through ServiceNow's channels \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This approach is detailed further in the *Strategic Revenue Considerations* section.
- **Go-to-Market Acceleration:** The planned co-sell and co-market partnership with ServiceNow provides immediate access to an established customer base, particularly targeting underpenetrated commercial HRSD customers \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*, p. unknown\].
- **Reduced Customer Risk:** Building on a "proven and secure platform" mitigates concerns large customers may have about adopting technology from an early-stage company, supporting the proposed premium price point relative to other mid-market solutions \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*, p. unknown\].

## Market Pricing Dynamics & Benchmarks

Novaworks' proposed pricing positions it as a premium solution, situated between established mid-market Human Capital Management (HCM) vendors and top-tier enterprise platforms. The strategy relies on justifying this premium through its AI-native architecture, focus on the underserved deskless workforce, and integration with the ServiceNow ecosystem. Analysis of competitive pricing and market norms indicates this positioning is ambitious for a new entrant and requires strong validation of its claimed return on investment (ROI), as outlined in the *Revenue Validation Strategy* section.

### Competitive Pricing Analysis

Novaworks plans to enter the market with a tiered Annual Contract Value (ACV) model, starting at $325,000 for its Tier 1 customers (5,000 Full-Time Employees) \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 12\]. This price point is significantly higher than typical mid-market solutions, which often use a per-employee-per-month (PEPM) model, and positions Novaworks directly against the lower end of the enterprise market.

The company's pricing model is described as a hybrid of per-user and usage-based fees, with volume discounts for committed spending \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 13\]. This hybrid approach is common in the software industry, as it combines a stable recurring revenue base with the ability to scale pricing with customer value [Stripe](https://stripe.com/resources/more/hybrid-pricing-models?utm_source=openai). However, the initial $325,000 ACV is a substantial entry point compared to competitors.

The following table benchmarks Novaworks' proposed pricing against direct and indirect competitors in the mid-market and enterprise segments.

The analysis shows that Novaworks' entry price is above pure-play mid-market competitors like Personio and isolved but aims to be competitive with larger platforms like UKG and Workday, which it identifies as primary takeout targets \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 25\].

### Customer Budgets and Market Norms

The HCM software market accommodates a wide range of budgets, with typical spending between $4 and $30 PEPM [People Managing People — How Much Does HR Software Cost? A 2025 Pricing Guide](https://peoplemanagingpeople.com/hr-operations/hr-software-cost/). Novaworks' target ACV of $325,000 for a company with up to 5,000 employees places its effective PEPM at the higher end of this spectrum, confirming its premium positioning. This strategy targets customers with larger budgets who are seeking transformational solutions rather than incremental improvements. The primary buyers are identified as the CHRO and CIO, who control budgets for strategic platform investments \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 23\].

### Value Benchmarks and Price Sensitivity

Novaworks justifies its premium pricing through three primary value propositions:

1. **AI-Native Architecture**: The solution is built around agentic AI to automate workflows, which promises significant efficiency gains and allows managers to increase their span of control \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 3\]. This aligns with market trends where AI is seen as a key driver of value and differentiation ([Humatica — Navigating AI Disruption: The New Economies of Operating Leverage](https://www.humatica.com/insights/navigating-ai-disruption-the-new-economies-of-operating-leverage/)).
2. **Focus on Deskless Workers**: The platform specifically targets the deskless workforce, a large segment (80% of the global total) that has been historically underserved by traditional HCM systems \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 5\]. Solving acute pain points for this segment could reduce price sensitivity.
3. **ServiceNow Platform Integration**: By building on ServiceNow, Novaworks offers customers a solution on a familiar, secure, and extensible enterprise platform. This reduces perceived risk and can lower the total cost of ownership by minimizing integration complexity, a key factor for enterprise buyers \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. 11\].

The central assumption is that customers will recognize and be willing to pay for these differentiators over lower-cost, established alternatives.

### Market Evolution and Pricing Trajectory

The broader HCM market dynamics appear favorable to Novaworks' strategy. Gartner projects that HCM software providers will increase subscription prices by an average of 3% to 5% over the next two to three years \[DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. 3\]. This industry-wide price inflation provides a supportive environment for a premium-priced new entrant. Furthermore, market growth is heavily driven by investments in modernizing legacy systems and adopting emerging technologies like AI, which directly aligns with Novaworks' core value proposition \[DOC: Forecast_Analysis_H.pptx, p. 4\].

While Novaworks' pricing is aggressive, it is strategically consistent with its product positioning and prevailing market trends. The primary challenge will be to demonstrate tangible ROI quickly to justify the premium over established competitors in a 6-9 month sales cycle \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 23\]. The lack of a proven track record makes early customer validation of this price point a critical milestone.

## Unit Economics & Margin Structure

Novaworks' unit economics are predicated on a high-value enterprise sales model, with projections showing rapid improvement in margins and customer lifetime value. However, these forecasts rely on exceptionally optimistic assumptions regarding customer acquisition efficiency that require significant validation.

### Revenue and Cost Components

Novaworks projects an Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) between $355,500 in 2026 and $637,000 in 2028, derived from a tiered pricing model with annual contract values (ACVs) ranging from $325,000 to $1,750,000 depending on customer size \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\]. The company plans a hybrid pricing model combining per-user fees with usage-based charges, a structure gaining traction in the software industry \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], [Stripe](https://stripe.com/resources/more/hybrid-pricing-models?utm_source=openai).

The primary direct costs (Cost of Sales) will include cloud hosting on platforms like AWS or Azure, consumption-based fees for third-party Large Language Models (LLMs), and expenses related to customer implementation and support \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*, p. unknown\]. Initially, the engineering team will also handle customer support, which will concentrate technical expertise but may blur the line between development expenses and cost of goods sold \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The most significant cost uncertainty is the expense of LLM usage, which could materially affect margins as the customer base and product usage scale.

### Gross Margin Analysis

Novaworks projects its gross margin will improve from 54.0% in 2026 to 79.2% by 2028 \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\]. This target aligns with healthy SaaS industry benchmarks, where margins of 75% are common and figures below 70% can be a concern for investors [HiBob](https://www.hibob.com/financial-metrics/gross-margin/).

A notable discrepancy exists within the company's presentation, which projects a Year 3 (2028) gross margin of 79.2% in one analysis but 69% in its formal financial outlook \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\]. This inconsistency raises questions about the reliability of the financial modeling. While the projected margin improvement is plausible as the company scales, achieving the higher-end target depends heavily on managing the variable costs of LLM services and achieving efficiencies in customer support.

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and Acquisition Cost (CAC)

The company's projections for LTV and CAC present a significant area of concern due to their optimistic nature. The LTV to CAC ratio is a critical measure of long-term profitability, with a benchmark of 3:1 considered healthy for SaaS businesses [StartupFinancialProjection.com](https://startupfinancialprojection.com/blogs/profitability/human-resource-software). Novaworks' projections, summarized below, far exceed this standard.

| Metric | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | \*\*| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | \**| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)*** \*| $320,297 | $124,757 | $95,380 | \**| **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)*** \*| $3,837,375 | $9,424,205 | $10,085,059 | \**| **LTV/CAC Ratio*** \*| 12.0x | 75.5x | 105.7x | ***Source: \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\]***

The projected LTV is based on a modeled annual churn rate of 5% \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_, p. unknown\], which is consistent with the B2B software industry average of 5-7% [StartupFinancialProjection.com](https://startupfinancialprojection.com/blogs/kpis/payroll-hr). However, the LTV/CAC ratios of 75.5x and 105.7x are exceptionally high and suggest unrealistic assumptions about the efficiency of the go-to-market strategy. While a detailed analysis of the sales model belongs in the Go-to-Market chapter, the unit economics are fundamentally dependent on achieving these aggressive CAC targets.

### Scalability and Corporate Advantages

The projected improvement in unit economics hinges on two factors: scaling efficiencies and corporate advantages from the ServiceNow partnership. Gross margins are expected to increase as fixed support and infrastructure costs are spread across a larger customer base. The dramatic decrease in projected CAC from over $320,000 to under $96,000 is the primary driver of the LTV/CAC ratio improvement and is attributed to leveraging partner sales channels, as discussed in *Strategic Revenue Considerations* \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

Building on the ServiceNow platform provides a distinct corporate advantage. This approach may lower infrastructure, security, and compliance costs by using an established enterprise-grade foundation. More importantly, the co-sell partnership with ServiceNow is positioned as the key to achieving the low customer acquisition costs that underpin the entire economic model. The viability of these unit economics is therefore directly tied to the successful execution of the partnership strategy.

## Revenue Validation Strategy

As a pre-product and pre-revenue company, Novaworks' primary challenge is to translate its value proposition into tangible customer commitment. The proposed revenue model, which combines per-user and usage-based fees, is consistent with industry trends \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], [Stripe](https://stripe.com/resources/more/hybrid-pricing-models). However, its target annual contract value (ACV) of $325,000 for its smallest customer tier positions it at a significant premium to established mid-market competitors \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. unknown\]. Therefore, the validation strategy must prioritize securing financial commitments that de-risk this premium pricing and confirm customers will pay to either replace or supplement their existing Human Capital Management (HCM) systems \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Commitment Tests with Design Partners

The most direct path to revenue validation lies with the committed "customer zero" partners: ServiceNow, Bell Canada, and Ateko \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. Verbal interest must be converted into financial commitment to serve as the minimum viable revenue validation.

- **Proposed Experiment**: Following the full MVP release scheduled for May 2026, Novaworks should initiate a structured, 6-month paid pilot program with these three partners \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The pilot price should be set at 25-40% of the target ACV, representing a material budget allocation rather than a nominal fee. This tests not only the product's value but also the partners' ability to secure internal budget, a key step in enterprise procurement [G2](https://learn.g2.com/hr-software-pricing).
- **Success Criteria**: At least two of the three "customer zero" partners sign a paid pilot agreement by the end of Q2 2026. This would validate initial willingness-to-pay from strategically aligned and well-understood customers.

### Pricing Elasticity Experiments

To validate the proposed premium pricing against the broader market, Novaworks must test price sensitivity with its next cohort of prospective customers. The company aims to sign 7-10 design partners by June 2026, creating an ideal test group \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

- **Proposed Experiment**: Novaworks should develop a multi-tiered pilot offering to present to this cohort. This allows for testing different value propositions and price points simultaneously.
  - **Offer A (Core Suite Pilot)**: A pilot of the foundational HCM module priced at a discount to the target $325,000 Tier 1 ACV.
  - **Offer B (Agentic Module Pilot)**: A lower-cost pilot focused exclusively on the AI-driven "SuperAgent" functionality for deskless workers, testing the value of the core differentiator.
  - **Offer C (Usage-Based Pilot)**: A pilot priced primarily on consumption metrics (e.g., number of automated workflows executed), directly testing the usage-based component of the hybrid model.
- **Success Criteria**: Secure signed paid pilot agreements with at least three new customers from this cohort by the end of Q3 2026. The relative conversion rates of each offer will provide critical data on price elasticity and which features most effectively drive customer willingness-to-pay.

### Internal Validation and Channel Confirmation

A core assumption of the go-to-market strategy is the ability to leverage the ServiceNow partnership for co-selling and a potential combined SKU \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This channel must be validated early.

- **Proposed Experiment**: In parallel with product development, Novaworks' founders should work with ServiceNow's sales and partnership teams to identify 5-10 existing ServiceNow customers who fit the ideal profile (mid-enterprise, using EC Pro, approaching HCM renewal) \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\]. The objective is to secure non-binding Letters of Intent (LOIs) that outline specific pricing terms for a future pilot, contingent on the MVP meeting defined criteria.
- **Success Criteria**: Obtain at least three LOIs from qualified ServiceNow customers by the end of 2026. This would provide strong evidence that the ServiceNow channel is viable and that its customers perceive sufficient value in the Novaworks offering to consider a purchase.

### Kill Criteria

The project's revenue model assumptions should be considered invalid if key validation milestones are missed. The following criteria would indicate a need to either fundamentally pivot the monetization strategy or halt the project:

- **Design Partner Failure**: Inability to convert any of the three "customer zero" partners (ServiceNow, Bell Canada, Ateko) into a paid pilot agreement by the end of Q2 2026.
- **Market Rejection**: Failure to secure any paid pilots from the broader cohort of 7-10 prospects by the end of 2026, indicating that the price-to-value equation is misaligned with market expectations.
- **Channel Invalidation**: Lack of any LOIs or tangible pipeline progression from the targeted ServiceNow customer base after a dedicated outreach effort, suggesting the co-sell GTM assumption is flawed.

## Strategic Revenue Considerations

Novaworks' revenue strategy extends beyond direct sales, incorporating partnerships and platform leverage that present distinct opportunities and dependencies. The analysis focuses on the strategic implications of its pricing, channel model, and ecosystem integration, particularly in relation to its core partner, ServiceNow.

### Cannibalization Risk Assessment

The risk of Novaworks cannibalizing existing ServiceNow revenue appears low. The company's strategy is to extend, not replace, ServiceNow's current Human Resources Service Delivery (HRSD) offerings \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. Novaworks aims to provide the core Human Capital Management (HCM) System of Record (SOR) on the ServiceNow platform, a capability ServiceNow currently lacks \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. unknown\]. This positions Novaworks to displace competing SORs, such as Workday and SAP SuccessFactors, from within the ServiceNow ecosystem. The company notes that 80% of ServiceNow's HRSD customers use Workday, framing the primary opportunity as a "Workday take out scenario" that would increase the ServiceNow platform's value and customer retention \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Bundling and Channel Leverage Opportunities

The business model is fundamentally dependent on leveraging ServiceNow's market presence through bundling and channel partnerships. Novaworks plans to pursue a "Combined SKU Development with ServiceNow," creating a joint offering that bundles its HCM with ServiceNow products like EC Pro \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\], \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This approach is designed to accelerate market entry by using ServiceNow's established sales channels.

The go-to-market strategy relies on a combination of direct sales, co-selling with ServiceNow, and an OEM model \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. A critical assumption for the business model's success is the finalization of a ServiceNow partnership that includes co-sell and co-market opportunities, potentially with quota retirement for ServiceNow sellers \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. While this channel leverage provides access to a qualified customer base, it also creates a significant strategic dependency on the execution and health of the ServiceNow partnership. The management team anticipates that demand from the ServiceNow channel could be high enough to challenge its capacity to service new leads \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Strategic Pricing and Competitive Positioning

Novaworks employs a value-based pricing strategy, positioning its solution as a premium offering relative to mid-market competitors but as a cost-effective alternative to large enterprise incumbents. The company aims to price its core HCM module "at a premium over mid-market traditional HCM vendors and just below core Enterprise vendors (Workday and SAP SF)" \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. unknown\].

A competitive cost comparison for a 5,000-employee organization, also shown in the *Market Pricing Dynamics & Benchmarks*\* \*section, illustrates this positioning: \*\*| Vendor | Estimated Annual Cost (5k Emp) | \*\*| :--- | :--- | \*\*| Workday | $400,000 – $700,000+ | \**| **Novaworks (Target Tier 1 ACV)*** *| **$325,000*** \*| \*\*| HiBob | \~$240,000 | \*\*| isolved | \~$100,000 – $150,000 | ***Source: \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A40%3A26Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A40%3A26Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=97Ud5LIpE72LW40mv71erk6AxCGqUJ0tOq9xuNgTfXo%3D), p. unknown\]***

This pricing supports the "Workday takeout" strategy by offering a compelling return on investment driven by the integration and deployment efficiencies of the ServiceNow platform \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A40%3A26Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A40%3A26Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=97Ud5LIpE72LW40mv71erk6AxCGqUJ0tOq9xuNgTfXo%3D), p. unknown\]. The approach is not to compete on price alone but to justify a premium valuation through superior AI-native functionality and total cost of ownership advantages.

### Ecosystem Partnership Revenue Models

Beyond the central ServiceNow relationship, Novaworks plans to build a network of partners to deliver a comprehensive solution and create additional revenue streams. The strategy includes:

- **Services and GTM Partners**: A partnership with Ateko is planned to provide implementation services and go-to-market support, creating a symbiotic model where partners generate revenue from services related to the Novaworks platform \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A40%3A26Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A40%3A26Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=V%2B9oKFXVl0CnOoLd%2FdeKAIaEHle%2FJjX0%2B7h3mbdEvtY%3D), p. unknown\].
- **Technology and Integration Partners**: The company is pursuing partnerships with payroll and benefits providers like SequoiaOne, ADP, and Deel to complete its HCM offering \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A40%3A26Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A40%3A26Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=V%2B9oKFXVl0CnOoLd%2FdeKAIaEHle%2FJjX0%2B7h3mbdEvtY%3D), p. unknown\]. These integrations are critical for product completeness and may involve revenue-sharing or referral fee arrangements.

This ecosystem approach, which commonly uses revenue-sharing models to align incentives, allows Novaworks to focus on its core AI and HCM capabilities while relying on partners to provide specialized services and functionality [M ACCELERATOR by M Studio](https://maccelerator.la/en/blog/entrepreneurship/ecosystem-revenue-sharing-models-explained/?utm_source=openai), [QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/enterprise/revenue-sharing/?utm_source=openai).

## Claims

 1. Novaworks will use a hybrid monetization model combining recurring subscription fees with usage-based charges.
 2. The pricing structure is tiered by employee count, with a target ACV of $325,000 for the smallest tier (5,000 FTEs).
 3. The revenue model is enhanced by a planned co-sell and product bundling partnership with ServiceNow.
 4. Novaworks' entry price point is positioned above mid-market competitors but below enterprise vendors like Workday.
 5. The company projects its gross margin will improve from 54.0% in 2026 to 79.2% by 2028.

## Overview

Novaworks' projected unit economics are exceptionally aggressive and currently unsubstantiated by any operational data. The company forecasts a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) of $95,380, a Lifetime Value (LTV) over $10 million, a gross margin of 79.2%, and a CAC payback period of under three months by its third year of operations \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 11\], \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 29\]. These figures are entirely **Projected** with very low confidence. The model's viability hinges on achieving premium pricing well above market norms, a steep and unexplained decline in CAC, and rapid gross margin expansion. As a pre-product company, none of these assumptions have been validated, rendering the current model a high-risk hypothesis. The path to profitability is theoretical and requires successful execution on every optimistic assumption without accounting for realistic market friction or operational drag.

### Key Takeaways

- **Extreme Projections**: The company projects an LTV/CAC ratio of 105.7x and a CAC payback of 2.3 months by year three, figures that are far outside typical B2B SaaS benchmarks and lack a credible underlying mechanism.
- **No Validated Data**: All unit economic metrics are **Projected**. As a pre-revenue company, there is no historical or pilot data on pricing, acquisition costs, margins, or churn to substantiate the financial model.

## Risks

- **Model Unreliability**: The entire unit economic model is theoretical. Key inputs like a 5% annual churn rate, a 73% CAC reduction over two years, and a 25-point gross margin improvement are presented without underlying drivers, making the projections highly speculative \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 11\].
- **Unrealistic Payback Period**: The analyst-derived CAC payback of 2.3 months is exceptionally aggressive for an enterprise product with a stated 6-9 month sales cycle \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 29\]. This suggests a fundamental disconnect between the GTM strategy and financial projections.
- **Pricing Pressure**: The target average contract value (ACV) of $325k+ for Tier 1 customers is significantly higher than many established mid-market competitors, which price solutions for 5,000-employee companies between $100k-$240k annually \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 13\]. This premium positioning requires significant, unproven value differentiation.
- **Information Risk**: The lack of detailed, bottom-up builds for COGS and CAC prevents a thorough analysis of scalability. Without understanding cost drivers (e.g., hosting, support headcount, third-party LLM fees, sales commissions), it is impossible to verify the projected margins and acquisition efficiency.

## Next Steps

### Additional Evidence

- **Detailed Financial Model**: Request the complete financial model with all underlying assumption tabs for CAC (by channel, including headcount, program spend, and conversion rates), COGS (hosting costs, third-party data/API fees, customer support costs), and revenue (deal-by-deal pipeline).

### Derisking Actions

- **Pricing Validation**: Conduct willingness-to-pay interviews with 10-15 target CIO/CHRO personas to test the proposed $325k+ ACV. **Success Criteria**: At least 50% of interviewees confirm the price point is plausible for the value proposition described.
- **COGS Bottom-Up Build**: Develop a per-customer COGS model based on preliminary quotes from cloud providers (AWS/Azure) and key technology partners (e.g., LLM providers) based on projected usage for the first 10 customers. **Success Criteria**: The model validates a clear path to achieving the projected 79% gross margin at scale.
- **Initial CAC Baselining**: Allocate a $15k test budget to one digital acquisition channel targeting ServiceNow customers to establish a baseline Cost Per Lead (CPL) and initial conversion estimates. **Success Criteria**: Generate empirical data to replace at least one assumption in the top-down CAC model.

## Pricing & Revenue per Unit

**Data Coverage & Confidence:** Medium | Confidence: 2/5

**Method & Definitions:**

- **Revenue Model:**

The company plans a hybrid model combining per-user and usage-based pricing, with volume discounts for committed, pre-paid contracts \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 12\].

- **Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU):** Calculated as total annual revenue divided by the number of customers.

**Results (with tags):**

- **Projected Pricing Tiers:** Novaworks has established three customer tiers with corresponding ACV price ranges \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 12\]:

  - Tier 1 ( 5,000 FTEs): $325,000 ACV
  - Tier 2 (5,000 – 20,000 FTEs): $620,000 ACV
  - Tier 3 ( 20,000 FTEs): $1,750,000 ACV

- **Projected ARPU:**

The model projects ARPU to grow from $355,500 in 2026 to $636,986 by 2028 (**Projected**) \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 11\]. ⚠️ **Plausible** only if the company can consistently land Tier 2 and 3 customers, but this is unproven.

**Reality Check & Red Flags:**

- 🚩 **Premium Positioning Risk:** The entry-level projected ACV of $325k is substantially higher than established mid-market competitors. For a 5,000-employee company, HiBob is estimated at \~$240k and iSolved at \~$100k-$150k \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 13\]. **Web-Search Results** show per-employee pricing for competitors like BambooHR ($12-$22) and Rippling ($21-$29) which would also result in lower ACVs for a 5,000-employee firm ([G2](https://learn.g2.com/hr-software-pricing), [Calamari](https://www.calamari.io/blog/bamboohr-vs-hibob-vs-rippling)). Novaworks' pricing assumes it can command a premium similar to enterprise leaders like Workday from its first day in market, which is a significant risk.

## COGS & Gross Margin

**Data Coverage & Confidence:** Low | Confidence: 1/5

This topic is in **Low-Data Mode**

due to the absence of a detailed cost breakdown.

- **What We Know:** The company projects gross margin to be 54.0% in 2026, rising to 77.9% in 2027 and 79.2% in 2028 (**Projected**) \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 11\]. The company acknowledges that COGS will include operational costs for LLM technology and cloud hosting (e.g., AWS) \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 21\].
- **What We Don’t Know:** There is no breakdown of COGS. Key costs such as cloud infrastructure, third-party software/API fees (especially for LLMs), customer support personnel, and implementation services are not detailed. The mechanism driving the projected 25-point margin expansion between Year 1 and Year 3 is entirely unexplained.
- **Implications:** Without a bottom-up COGS model, the projected gross margin is unreliable. A higher-than-expected cost structure, particularly from LLM usage, could fundamentally impair unit economics and delay profitability. The 79% target is in line with the median for SaaS companies (**Web-Search Results**) [Benchmarkit](https://www.benchmarkit.ai/2024benchmarks), but the path to achieving it from a 54% starting point is unclear.
- **Targeted Data Requests:**
  1. A detailed, bottom-up COGS forecast for a single customer.
  2. Preliminary quotes or cost estimates for cloud hosting and third-party LLM usage.
  3. Staffing plan for customer support and implementation teams, including cost per employee.
- **30–90 Day Validation Plan:** Obtain preliminary usage-based cost models from AWS/Azure and a primary LLM provider. Model the costs for the first 10 projected customers to validate the scalability of the gross margin. **Success Criteria:** The model shows a credible path to achieving 75% gross margin by the 20th customer.

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Data Coverage & Confidence:** Low | Confidence: 1/5

This topic is in **Low-Data Mode**

due to the lack of supporting detail for the CAC projections.

- **What We Know:** The company projects a blended CAC of $320,297 in 2026, decreasing to $124,757 in 2027, and $95,380 in 2028 (**Projected**) \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 11\]. The stated sales cycle is 6-9 months \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 29\].
- **What We Don’t Know:** The model provides no breakdown of sales and marketing expenses, channel-specific costs, conversion rates, or sales team productivity assumptions. The driver behind the projected 70%+ CAC reduction over two years is not explained.
- **Implications:** The CAC figures are effectively meaningless without the underlying drivers. A 6-9 month enterprise sales cycle typically involves significant personnel costs (sales executives, solutions engineers) that may not be fully captured in this top-down figure. The projected CAC is a major risk; if costs do not decline as steeply as modeled, the entire economic proposition fails. **Web-Search Results** on B2B SaaS CAC are highly variable, but a \~$100k CAC for a $300k ACV product is plausible *at scale*, but the initial $320k figure and its rapid decline are questionable without evidence of extreme efficiency gains ([Curio Revelio](https://www.curiorevelio.com/content/articles/startup-cac-benchmarks)).
- **Targeted Data Requests:**
  1. Sales and marketing budget breakdown (headcount, commissions, program spend).
  2. Assumptions for lead-to-close conversion rates.
  3. Sales team hiring plan and quota attainment assumptions.
- **30–90 Day Validation Plan:** Launch a pilot lead generation campaign on a single channel (e.g., LinkedIn ads targeting HR leaders at ServiceNow customers) with a $15k budget. **Success Criteria:** Establish a baseline Cost Per Lead (CPL) and Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) rate to inform a more credible, bottom-up CAC projection.

## LTV & Retention/Churn

**Data Coverage & Confidence:** Low | Confidence: 1/5

This topic is in **Low-Data Mode**

as all figures are aspirational.

- **What We Know:** The company projects LTV to grow from $3.8M in 2026 to over $10M by 2028 (**Projected**) \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 11\]. This is based on a modeled annual churn of 5% and an average contract length of 3 years (**Projected**) \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 11\], \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 29\].
- **What We Don’t Know:** As a pre-product company, there is no data on actual customer retention, logo churn, or net revenue retention (NRR). The 5% annual churn figure is an assumption, and there are no explicit assumptions about expansion revenue, which is a key driver of LTV for enterprise SaaS.
- **Implications:** The LTV calculation is highly sensitive to the churn assumption. A small increase in churn would dramatically reduce LTV and the viability of the business model. The lack of any data or even detailed assumptions on expansion revenue makes the LTV projection incomplete.
- **Targeted Data Requests:**
  1. Explicit assumptions for net revenue retention, detailing expected upsell/expansion behavior.
  2. Benchmark data used to arrive at the 5% annual churn assumption.
- **30–90 Day Validation Plan:** For the first 3-5 design partners, establish a formal process for tracking product engagement, user satisfaction (NPS), and identifying expansion opportunities. **Success Criteria:** Develop a qualitative assessment of churn risk and a quantitative list of potential upsell modules for each design partner within 90 days of implementation.

## Payback Period

**Data Coverage & Confidence:** Low | Confidence: 1/5

**Method & Definitions:**

- **Gross Profit Payback Period (Months):** Calculated as CAC / (Monthly ARPU × Gross Margin %). This measures the time required for a customer's gross profit to repay the initial cost of acquisition.

**Results (with tags):**

- **Analyst-Derived Payback:** Based on the company's projections for 2028, the payback period is calculated as follows:
  - CAC: $95,380 (**Projected**)
  - Monthly Gross Profit per Customer: ($636,986 ARPU × 79.2% GM) / 12 = $42,160 (**Projected**)
  - **Payback Period = 2.3 months** (**Analyst-derived**)

**Reality Check & Red Flags:**

- ❌ **Unrealistic Payback:** A 2.3-month payback period for a B2B enterprise SaaS product with a 6-9 month sales cycle is unrealistic. Best-in-class companies typically target payback periods of 12-18 months. This result is a direct consequence of the extremely aggressive CAC, ARPU, and GM assumptions and is a major red flag for the entire financial model.

## Cohort Analysis

**Data Coverage & Confidence:** Low | Confidence: 1/5

This topic is in **Low-Data Mode**

as no data exists.

- **What We Know:** Nothing. The company is pre-revenue and has no customer cohorts.
- **What We Don’t Know:** All cohort behaviors, including initial adoption, retention over time, expansion rates, and cost to serve, are unknown.
- **Implications:** The financial model relies on blended averages that have not been validated by any cohort performance. Early cohort data will be critical to understanding the true health of the business and refining all unit economic assumptions.
- **Targeted Data Requests:** A plan for how the company will measure and report on cohort performance for its initial design partners.
- **30–90 Day Validation Plan:** Implement basic analytics tracking for the first cohort of design partners. **Success Criteria:** Produce a "First Cohort Report" 90 days after the first customer goes live, detailing user engagement, support tickets, and initial feedback.

## Sensitivity & Scenarios

The unit economics are highly sensitive to the model's core assumptions. The following table illustrates the impact of more conservative, and likely more realistic, adjustments to the company's 2028 projections.

## Claims

 1. The company projects a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) of $95,380 by its third year of operation.
 2. The company projects a customer Lifetime Value (LTV) exceeding $10 million by its third year.
 3. The projected LTV/CAC ratio is 105.7x by year three.
 4. The company models an annual customer churn rate of 5%.
 5. Gross margin is projected to expand from 54% in the first year of revenue to 79.2% in the third year.
 6. The analyst-derived CAC payback period based on company projections is 2.3 months, which is unrealistic for an enterprise B2B software company.
 7. The proposed entry-level pricing of $325,000 ACV is significantly higher than several established mid-market competitors.
 8. All unit economic figures are projected, as the company is pre-product and pre-revenue with no historical or pilot data.
 9. The financial model assumes a 70% reduction in CAC between the first and third years of operation without providing a clear mechanism.
10. The unit economic model is currently a high-risk hypothesis that requires extensive validation of its core assumptions on pricing, cost, and efficiency.



# Finance and Operations

Projections: Complete | Model: P&L-only Assumption Book: Basic | Evidence Types: \[Mgmt | Benchmark | Analyst\] Section Confidence (1–5): 2

## Overview

This chapter assesses the financial and operational feasibility of Novaworks' plan to launch an AI-native HCM platform. The analysis is based entirely on management's projections, as the company is pre-revenue. The plan requires a $7 million seed investment to fund 15-16 months of operations, covering product development, market launch, and initial customer acquisition \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 15\]. The financial model projects reaching near-EBITDA breakeven by the end of Year 3 on $13.1 million in revenue, but this outcome depends on a series of aggressive, unvalidated assumptions regarding hiring, sales velocity, and market adoption \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 16\].

### Key Takeaways

- **Aggressive Ramp Post-Launch**: The financial model projects $3.7 million in revenue and 22 customers in the first full year of sales (Year 2), requiring immediate and efficient conversion of a sales pipeline that does not yet exist \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 16\]. This timeline leaves no room for product delays or slower-than-expected market adoption.
- **Contradictory Operating Plans**: A significant discrepancy exists between the stated initial hiring plan of 15-17 employees and the financial model's Year 1 personnel expense, which implies a 47-person headcount \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. 9\], \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 16\]. This inconsistency undermines the credibility of the entire financial projection and suggests the model is not grounded in a realistic operational plan.

## Risks

- **Model Integrity**: The provided financial projections contain internal inconsistencies. Gross margin figures differ between the unit economics slide (54.0% in Y1) and the main financial outlook (64% in Y2, with Y1 not applicable) \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 11, 16\]. The lack of a detailed, driver-based model makes it impossible to audit the logic connecting operational activities to financial outcomes.
- **Insufficient Runway for Delays**: The requested $7 million seed round provides a projected 15-16 month runway, culminating in a trough cash balance of $667,000 at the end of Year 2 \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 15, 16\]. This leaves a minimal buffer for common early-stage challenges such as product development delays, a longer-than-expected 6-9 month sales cycle, or slower customer acquisition \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 25\].
- **Unrealistic Headcount Scaling**: The financial model's assumption of 47 full-time employees in Year 1 is not supported by the proposed $7 million capital raise or the founders' stated intent to start lean \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 16\], \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 6\]. A 47-person team would generate a burn rate far exceeding the planned funding.
- **Stacked Optimism**: The plan's success relies on the simultaneous achievement of multiple aggressive assumptions: a flawless product launch in May 2026, immediate sales traction with a 6-9 month cycle, rapid hiring and productivity, and the successful conversion of the unproven ServiceNow co-sell channel \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 13, 25\]. The failure of any single assumption would jeopardize the entire timeline and financial plan.

## Next Steps

### Additional Evidence

- **Critical Information Need**: A detailed, bottoms-up monthly financial model for the first 24 months is required. This model must reconcile the hiring plan (by role and start date), operational spending, and a capacity-based revenue forecast to demonstrate a viable path on the proposed capital.

### Derisking Actions

- **Validate Pricing and Sales Cycle**: **Action:** Conduct non-binding pricing conversations with 5-7 prospective design partners from the target profile. **Owner:** Kelley Steven-Waiss. **Success Metric:** Documented feedback confirming the proposed ACV range ($325k+) and validating the 6-9 month sales cycle assumption within 60 days.
- **Rebuild Operating Budget**: **Action:** Create a revised 24-month budget based on the stated initial team of 15-17 employees, layering in subsequent hires only as justified by specific milestones. **Owner:** Thomas Krieger. **Success Metric:** A revised budget that aligns with the $7M raise and provides at least 18 months of runway, delivered within 30 days.
- **Develop Capacity-Based Sales Model**: **Action:** Build a sales capacity model that clearly defines the number of Account Executives, their ramp time, quota, and win rates required to achieve the Year 2 bookings target. **Owner:** Stanimira Koleva. **Success Metric:** A model demonstrating how the bookings target can be met with a realistic number of sales hires funded by the seed round, completed within 45 days.

## Projection Baseline & Integrity

The financial projections are based on a high-level P&L summary and bookings forecast provided by management. As a pre-revenue company, all figures are hypothetical. The model lacks a detailed cash flow statement and balance sheet, limiting analysis of working capital and cash cycles.

*All figures are **Projection**. Source: \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 16\]. Y4-Y5 are Analyst projections based on bookings growth from \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 12\].\_

**Break-Even (Projection):**

EBITDA+ **Q4, Y3 – Q1, Y4**; Cash-Flow+ **Q1-Q2, Y4** — **Prereqs:** Achieving Y3 revenue target of $13.1M, maintaining projected 69% gross margin, and controlling headcount growth at 53 FTEs.

**Realism:** **Unrealistic**.

The model's integrity is compromised by conflicting data and an unexplained headcount figure in Year 1, making the path to breakeven highly speculative.

## Key Drivers & Assumptions

The model's outcomes are highly sensitive to a few critical, unvalidated assumptions.

## Cash, Burn & Runway

The proposed $7M raise is intended to last 15 months, but this runway is fragile and highly sensitive to revenue shortfalls.

- **Proposed Raise (Projection):** $7.0M
- **Avg Monthly Net Burn (first 15 mo):**

**Base:**

$424k | **Downside:** $475k

- **Runway:**

**Base:**

16.5 mo | **Downside:** 14.7 mo

- **Trough Cash:** $667k in Sep 2027 (Month 27)
- **Burn Mix (15-mo avg):** Headcount **67%**, GTM/Other OpEx **33**%*All figures are **Projection**. Calculations are Analyst estimates based on the 15-month Year 1 period (6/2025-9/2026) from \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 16\]. Downside assumes 0 revenue and a 10% increase in non-personnel expense.\_

## Capital Requirements & Use of Funds (Milestone-Linked)

The $7M raise is primarily allocated to personnel, with a heavy focus on R&D in the first year to achieve product launch.

**Assessment:**

The proposed raise barely reaches the next value inflection point (initial revenue traction) and preserves less than 3 months of downside runway at the cash trough in Year 2.

## Operational Resourcing & Capacity

A critical disconnect exists between the hiring plan described in the diligence questionnaire and the personnel expense in the financial model.

*The model implies 47 FTEs in Year 1, but the DDQ states a launch team of 15-17 \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-*Novaworks.pdf, p. 9\]. The implied functional split is an Analyst calculation based on Y1 expense allocation \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 15\].\_

**Capacity Math (Sales)Unrealistic**. The model projects $14.8M in bookings in the first year of sales (2026) \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 12\]. Assuming an average ACV of $325k, this requires closing **\~45 deals**. With a 6-9 month sales cycle, this implies the sales team must be fully ramped and engaging dozens of qualified leads almost immediately upon company funding, which is not feasible for a pre-product venture.

## Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis

The financial plan is highly sensitive to initial sales traction and pricing. A moderate delay in customer acquisition would require additional funding before Year 2.

**Scenarios**

- **Base:** Management plan as presented.
- **Upside:** Not modeled; would require outperforming an already aggressive plan.
- **Downside:** 50% of projected Y2 revenue, 10% higher COGS, no change in OpEx.

- Price -20% → **-4 months** (insolvent)

## Model ↔ Roadmap Alignment (next 18 months)

The financial plan is loosely aligned with the product roadmap, but the revenue ramp appears disconnected from the operational realities of launching a new enterprise product.

</table>

**🚩 Red-Flags:**

- **Year-1 revenue without signed pipeline:** The model books $14.8M in the first 12 months of sales with no existing pipeline or validated sales channel.
- **Hockey-stick dependent on unproven channels:** The entire growth story relies on the ServiceNow co-sell partnership, the economics and lead velocity of which are complete unknowns.
- **Stacked optimism:** The plan requires a perfect product launch, immediate market acceptance, and flawless GTM execution to avoid running out of cash.

# Team and Execution

## Overview

The key team members—CEO Kelley Steven-Waiss, CTO Eswar Vandanapu, and GTM lead Stanimira Koleva—are highly credible, combining prior entrepreneurial exits with deep corporate experience at firms like ServiceNow and Microsoft. This unique blend of skills makes the team exceptionally well-positioned to succeed, particularly in navigating the critical ServiceNow partnership, which is central to their strategy. However, significant talent risks could derail the initiative, including an extreme key-person dependency on the three founders and intense competition for scarce AI talent. The most critical talent gap to fill immediately is the vacant Chief Data & AI Officer role; this position must be filled by an experienced enterprise SaaS leader before the main product build-out begins to validate the company's "AI-native" claims.

### Key Takeaways

- **Exceptional Founder Fit**: The founding team's blend of entrepreneurial success (prior exits) and deep corporate fluency (ex-ServiceNow CEO) is a rare and powerful combination, providing exceptional credibility and navigation skills for the critical ServiceNow partnership.
- **Concentrated Risk Profile**: The venture faces extreme key-person risk, with the three founders covering all critical functions, and a significant capability gap exists with the unfilled Chief Data & AI Officer role, which is vital for an "AI-native" company.

## Risks

- **Founder Over-reliance**: Execution capability is dangerously concentrated in three individuals. The loss of any founder would severely impact the product roadmap and go-to-market strategy, as they currently hold all key leadership roles.
- **Critical Leadership Gap**: The absence of a Chief Data & AI Officer undermines the company's "AI-native" positioning and introduces significant risk to its core product strategy and technical execution.
- **Talent Competition & Retention**: The company must compete for scarce, expensive AI talent against better-funded startups. Failure to attract and retain key engineers could derail the aggressive product timeline.
- **Cultural Friction with Partner**: The team's agile, risk-tolerant startup culture may clash with the processes and priorities of its primary corporate partner, ServiceNow, potentially slowing execution and creating relationship friction.

## Next Steps

**Additional Evidence**

- **AI Leadership Pipeline**: Request a short-list of candidates and a formal role description for the Chief Data & AI Officer to assess the quality of the talent pipeline and the seriousness of the search.
- **Conflict of Interest Documentation**: Obtain the conflict of interest forms filed by the founders with ServiceNow to understand the specific guardrails and potential limitations on their activities.

**Derisking Actions**

- **Mitigate Founder Over-reliance**: Task the founders with creating a 90-day operational plan that explicitly delegates at least one major responsibility from each founder to a new hire or a senior advisor to test knowledge transfer and reduce bottlenecks.
- **Accelerate AI Leadership Hiring**: Mandate the engagement of a specialized executive search firm within 30 days to fill the Chief Data & AI Officer role, with a target hire date before the January 2026 MVP deadline.
- **Validate Compensation Strategy**: Commission a compensation benchmark analysis within 60 days, specifically against AI-native, venture-backed startups, to ensure the equity and salary packages are competitive enough to attract top talent.
- **Formalize Partner Governance**: Establish a formal monthly check-in between the Novaworks CEO and their primary ServiceNow partnership contact to proactively identify and resolve potential cultural or operational misalignments.

## Core Team Composition & Roles

The founding team comprises three executives with complementary experience in corporate innovation, technology development, and global go-to-market strategy. The initial structure is lean, with the founders covering multiple essential functions. However, the proposed organizational chart for scaling reveals several key roles that are currently unfilled, presenting both an opportunity to attract talent and a near-term execution risk.

### Founding Team and Key Executives

The core team consists of Kelley Steven-Waiss (CEO), Eswar Vandanapu (CTO), and Stanimira Koleva (GTM lead). Their backgrounds combine deep domain expertise in Human Capital Management (HCM), entrepreneurial experience, and experience navigating large technology enterprises like ServiceNow and Microsoft.

### Role Coverage and Identified Gaps

The founding team provides strong initial coverage across the essential roles required for a corporate venture. However, the company's own materials reveal significant gaps between the immediate lean team and the broader organization required to execute its vision. This over-reliance on the founders is a central theme also discussed in the *Talent Risks & Retention Strategy* section.

**Essential Role Coverage:**

- **Innovation Leader & Corporate Navigator:** Kelley Steven-Waiss fills both roles. Her experience as a second-time founder and former Chief Innovation Officer at ServiceNow provides credibility and a vision for the product. Her history within ServiceNow is critical for navigating the partnership central to the company's strategy \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Technical Expert:** Eswar Vandanapu provides the core technical and product development leadership required to build the platform \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Business Developer:** Stanimira Koleva is designated to lead partnerships and GTM, a crucial function given the reliance on the ServiceNow ecosystem. In the interim, Kelley Steven-Waiss will lead founder-led sales \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

**Identified Gaps and Missing Roles:**

- **Chief Data & AI Officer:** The company's investor presentation lists this as a "TBD" role \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 17\]. For a company positioning itself as an "AI-native" solution, the absence of a dedicated leader for data and AI strategy is a critical gap, a point further analyzed in the *Innovation Capability Assessment* and *Talent Sourcing & Development Strategy* sections.
- **Dedicated Product Leadership:** A conflict exists between the company's documents. The due diligence questionnaire states Kelley Steven-Waiss will serve as acting Chief Product Officer, while the investor deck names Melanie Lougee for the role \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 17\]. This suggests that many of the functional heads presented in the pitch deck are aspirational hires rather than committed team members, creating a potential leadership vacuum in key areas like product management, marketing, and design post-funding.
- **Full-Time GTM Leadership:** Stanimira Koleva's planned part-time start, with a transition to full-time in January 2026, leaves a near-term gap in dedicated leadership for the crucial partnership and sales functions during the initial product build-out phase \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

The initial team of 4-5 US-based staff and 10 in India is consistent with the lean structure of modern AI-native startups, which prioritize small, high-agency teams over large headcounts [AI-Native Startup Handbook | Build & Scale Your AI-First Company](https://www.aiatflytbase.com/startup-handbook), [What every startup can learn from AI-native hiring: Smaller teams, higher salaries, and the ‘Super IC’](https://ravio.com/blog/ai-native-startup-hiring). However, the heavy reliance on the three founders to cover numerous strategic functions simultaneously creates significant key-person risk.

## Innovation Capability Assessment

The Novaworks team demonstrates a rare and valuable combination of proven entrepreneurial execution and deep corporate fluency. The founders have direct experience building and successfully exiting technology startups, complemented by extensive careers navigating the complex internal environments of large enterprises they now target as customers. This blend of capabilities is critical for executing an ambitious product vision that depends on both rapid innovation and a strategic partnership with a major platform provider.

### Entrepreneurial and Technical Competence

The core leadership team possesses a credible track record of building technology companies from inception. CEO Kelley Steven-Waiss is a second-time founder, having previously founded Hitch Works, a talent mobility platform acquired by ServiceNow [Justia Patents](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/steven-kelley), \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This prior success provides direct evidence of her ability to build a product, achieve market traction, and navigate a successful exit. Similarly, CTO Eswar Vandanapu is a serial entrepreneur and a "successful exited CTO" who has also built and sold an operations business in India \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

The team's technical competence is centered on Vandanapu, whose background includes engineering leadership at Oracle and serving as CTO for a 350-person Series C company \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The planned organizational structure includes identified leaders for key technical roles such as ServiceNow architecture, mobile development, and data engineering \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 17\]. However, two notable challenges exist. First, the company is pre-product due to intellectual property constraints, meaning the team has not yet executed on this specific vision together \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. Second, the Chief Data & AI Officer role remains unfilled, a significant gap for a company positioning itself as an "AI-native" solution, as also noted in Core Team Composition & Roles \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 17\].

### Corporate Fluency and Network Strength

The team is exceptionally well-equipped to navigate the corporate landscape. Steven-Waiss's experience as a former CHRO and Chief Innovation Officer provides her with the perspective of a target buyer, deep domain expertise, and a "network of other buyers that trust her" \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This insider knowledge is critical for product-market fit and sales execution. Stanimira Koleva, Head of Global GTM, brings extensive experience managing large-scale partnerships at companies like Cisco, Citrix, and Microsoft, which is directly applicable to managing the crucial ServiceNow relationship \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

This corporate fluency is amplified by a formidable network. The company has assembled two advisory boards: one with senior executives from ServiceNow, PeopleSoft, and Aon, and another composed entirely of CHROs from major enterprises including Cigna, Petco, and Bell Canada \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 18\]. This network, detailed further in *Talent Sourcing & Development Strategy*, provides unparalleled access to market feedback, potential design partners, and strategic guidance. The team has already leveraged these connections to establish "customer zero" relationships with ServiceNow and Bell Canada, demonstrating an ability to translate network access into tangible business opportunities \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Learning Velocity and Iteration

Novaworks has outlined an aggressive development timeline that prioritizes rapid learning and iteration. The plan is to deliver a limited MVP by January for partner feedback, followed by a full MVP release in May to coincide with the ServiceNow Knowledge event \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The product development process is structured in three phases: building foundational capabilities based on the core vision, refining requirements with design partners, and rapidly iterating based on early sales objections \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This approach indicates a strong orientation toward hypothesis-driven development and market validation. While this planned velocity is high, it remains untested, as the team has not yet begun development post-funding.

## Talent Sourcing & Development Strategy

Novaworks' talent strategy prioritizes capital efficiency and deep product expertise in its initial phase, followed by a rapid scaling of go-to-market (GTM) and customer-facing roles post-launch. The approach relies on a lean, geographically distributed team, augmented by strategic contractors and a robust advisory network to fill immediate expertise gaps. However, a critical leadership role in AI remains unfilled, and a formal plan for team development is not yet defined.

### External Hiring Strategy

The company plans a phased hiring approach, beginning with a lean R&D-focused team and expanding significantly after the product's minimum viable product (MVP) is established. This aligns with hiring patterns of other AI-native startups that concentrate headcount in engineering and data teams while remaining lean in commercial functions [Ravio](https://ravio.com/blog/ai-native-startup-hiring), [AI at FlytBase](https://www.aiatflytbase.com/startup-handbook).

The initial team at launch will consist of approximately 15 people: 4-5 employees in the US, 1 in Dubai, and 10 in India \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This core group is projected to expand to 47 full-time employees within the first 15 months, with R&D roles comprising 56% of the initial year's personnel expense \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 15, 16\].

A key vulnerability in the hiring plan is the vacant Chief Data & AI Officer position, a critical role for an AI-native company, as highlighted in both the *Core Team Composition & Roles* and *Innovation Capability Assessment* sections \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 17\]. Filling this role is the most immediate priority to ensure the product's technical and strategic direction aligns with its core value proposition. The plan to hire more AI specialists is contingent on available capital, which could delay roadmap acceleration \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

The hiring plan prioritizes roles as outlined below:

</table>

### Advisory Network

Novaworks has established a strong advisory network that serves as a primary source of strategic guidance and industry access, compensating for the lean initial team. The network is structured into two distinct groups:

- **CEO Advisors**: This group includes senior executives with deep operational and technical experience, including several current and former ServiceNow leaders (Pat Casey, Manish Shah, Rag Bhagavatha). This provides Novaworks with critical domain expertise and an informal channel to navigate its strategic partnership with ServiceNow \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 18\].
- **Industry CHRO Advisory Board**: Comprising Chief Human Resources Officers from target customers like Bell Canada, ServiceNow, and Cigna, this board offers direct access to the target buyer persona. This group is positioned to provide invaluable feedback for product development and validation, and potentially serve as a source for early customer introductions \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 18\].

Additionally, former founding team member Manish Shah will act as an advisor, leveraging his healthcare industry network for future vertical expansion \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Partner Resources

To accelerate development while managing costs, Novaworks plans to augment its core engineering team with contractors sourced from strategic partners and investors \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This strategy provides flexibility to meet the aggressive MVP timeline for the ServiceNow partner kickoff in January and the full launch in May. While this approach allows for rapid scaling, it also introduces dependencies on third-party resources for critical path development. The implications of this on intellectual property are addressed in the \[CHAPTER: Legal and IP\].

### Team Development Plan

The provided documents do not contain a formal strategy for employee training or skill development. At this pre-launch stage, development is expected to be informal, driven by the hands-on process of building the product and engaging with design partners. The advisory boards are a significant asset for mentoring the executive team. Furthermore, CEO Kelley Steven-Waiss has established a core principle that "everyone is in Sales," requiring all leaders to be customer-facing \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This mandate serves as an informal mechanism for cross-functional development, ensuring that technical and product teams maintain a direct connection to market needs.

## Team Structure & Governance

Novaworks plans to operate with a lean, founder-led organizational model designed for capital efficiency and rapid execution, a structure consistent with benchmarks for AI-native startups \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], [AI at FlytBase](https://www.aiatflytbase.com/startup-handbook). The governance framework relies on a combination of a formal board, strategic partner integration, and an industry-focused advisory council to guide strategy and maintain accountability.

### Reporting Structure and Organizational Design

The initial organizational structure is flat, concentrating on product development while outsourcing general and administrative functions \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. At launch, the team will consist of 15-17 people distributed across the US (4-5), Dubai (1), and India (10) \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This R&D-heavy allocation aligns with the company's Year 1 budget, which dedicates 56% of FTE expense to R&D, and is typical for AI-native companies that prioritize engineering and data talent over commercial functions in the early stages \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 15\], [Ravio](https://ravio.com/blog/ai-native-startup-hiring).

The proposed Board of Directors will provide formal oversight, with a structure designed to integrate key stakeholders.

| Proposed Board Role | Description | \*\*| :--- | :--- | \**| **Executive Directors*** *| The CEO (Kelley Steven-Waiss) and CTO (Eswar Vandanapu) will hold board seats, ensuring direct operational linkage.* \*| \**| **Investor Director*** *| The lead investor will have a dedicated seat, providing financial oversight and strategic guidance.* \*| \**| **Partner Directors*** *| Representation from key partners Ateko and Bell Canada is planned, intended to align product and go-to-market strategies with crucial early customers and channels.* \*| \**| **Independent Director*** *| One independent director with SaaS and early-stage growth experience will be mutually selected to provide impartial expertise and governance.* \*| ***Source: \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]***

This board composition provides a direct line of accountability to investors and strategic partners. The board is expected to meet quarterly and on an as-needed basis \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Decision Rights

Decision-making authority is concentrated within the founding team to facilitate speed. Responsibilities are clearly delineated:

- **Kelley Steven-Waiss (CEO)**: Leads overall strategy, product vision, sales, and operations, acting as the central decision-maker for commercial and product direction \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Eswar Vandanapu (CTO)**: Holds authority over technology execution, technical strategy, inbound product management, and leadership of the India-based development team \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **Stanimira Koleva (GTM Lead)**: Manages partnerships, global go-to-market efforts, and sales operations \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

This structure minimizes bureaucracy but places significant operational load on the three key executives, creating a potential bottleneck risk as the company scales.

### Integration Points

The governance model incorporates several formal integration points to connect the team with key partners and the target market:

- **Board-Level Integration**: The inclusion of Ateko and Bell Canada on the proposed board creates a formal channel for strategic alignment with launch customers and go-to-market partners \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].
- **CHRO Advisory Board**: The company plans to establish an advisory board of Chief Human Resources Officers and other industry experts. This group will serve as a direct feedback channel from the target buyer persona, influencing product requirements and market positioning \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\], \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 18\].
- **Partner Operations**: The go-to-market strategy relies on co-sell and co-market motions with ServiceNow, requiring deep operational integration with ServiceNow's sales and partnership teams \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Performance Metrics & Communication

As a pre-product company, initial performance metrics are milestone-based rather than financial. The primary goals are product delivery and early market validation:

1. Deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) for the ServiceNow partner kickoff in January 2026.
2. Release a full MVP and exit stealth mode for the ServiceNow Knowledge event in May 2026.
3. Secure 7-10 design partners or prospective customers by the end of June 2026. \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]

The team has established a clear communication cadence to ensure accountability. Management plans to review progress, cash burn, and other key performance indicators on a monthly basis. A monthly newsletter will be distributed to investors and advisors to report on progress against these milestones \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

## Team Dynamics & Culture

The Novaworks team exhibits a culture and dynamic well-suited for an early-stage venture, characterized by a hands-on leadership style, a lean operational ethos, and a high tolerance for risk. However, this startup culture must navigate the complexities of its deep integration with and dependence on a large corporate partner, ServiceNow, which presents a significant potential for friction.

### Leadership Style and Vision

The leadership approach is founder-led, customer-centric, and intensely hands-on. CEO Kelley Steven-Waiss articulates a core principle that "everyone is in Sales," indicating an expectation for all team members to be customer-facing and commercially aware \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This directive style is balanced by a desire for collaborative partnership, seeking investors who will "brainstorm with us" \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The company's stated core values—including "Be Bold," "Learn Fast," and "Win Together"—reinforce a vision for a culture centered on innovation, agility, and collaboration \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Team Chemistry and Work Style

The team has established a lean, agile work style focused on capital efficiency and rapid iteration. A key decision was to forgo hiring a founding COO to "keep organization lean" and manage cash burn, instead retaining the individual as an advisor \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This pragmatic decision suggests the team can align on difficult strategic choices. The operational plan prioritizes R&D and product development, with a phased approach to validate requirements with design partners before a full launch \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This model aligns with established benchmarks for AI-native startups, which emphasize small, cross-functional teams and high-agency operators over early headcount growth [AI at FlytBase](https://www.aiatflytbase.com/startup-handbook), [Ravio](https://ravio.com/blog/ai-native-startup-hiring). The plan for developers to handle initial customer support further reinforces a culture of ownership and tight customer feedback loops \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\].

### Risk Tolerance and Resilience

The founding team demonstrates a high tolerance for ambiguity and risk, which is necessary for its ambitious goal of disrupting the established HCM market. Both the CEO and CTO are described as second-time or serial entrepreneurs, indicating comfort with the startup lifecycle \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. They explicitly acknowledge the risks of competing with incumbents like Workday and SAP but believe that "AI lowered the barriers to entry to take out the Giants" \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. This perspective shows an awareness of competitive threats combined with a conviction in their strategic timing and approach.

### Cultural Alignment and Potential Friction

Novaworks' culture is fundamentally shaped by its symbiotic relationship with ServiceNow, which is both an asset and a source of potential conflict. The founders' status as current ServiceNow employees provides them with invaluable insider knowledge to navigate the partnership. However, this dual identity creates a significant challenge in balancing the fast-paced, risk-tolerant culture of a startup with the processes and politics of a large public company. While the team has filed conflict of interest forms, the risk of encountering "corporate antibodies" remains \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. unknown\]. The primary cultural friction point will be maintaining agility and entrepreneurial speed while adhering to the governance and strategic priorities of its primary partner and distribution channel.

## Talent Risks & Retention Strategy

The primary talent risks for Novaworks center on its significant reliance on the founding team and the intense competition for specialized AI talent. While the team's experience is a core asset, its lean structure creates operational vulnerabilities. Mitigation strategies must focus on distributing knowledge, offering competitive compensation, and deliberately building a resilient organizational culture to manage the pressures of rapid growth.

### Key Person Risk

Novaworks exhibits a high degree of key person risk, with critical strategic and operational functions concentrated within its three founders. Kelley Steven-Waiss (CEO) is also acting as the Chief Product Officer, Chief Sales Officer, and COO \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. 6\]. Eswar Vandanapu (CTO) leads all technology, product management, India operations, and technical customer success, while Stanimira Koleva is responsible for all global go-to-market and partnership activities \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 6\]. The departure of any founder, particularly in the first 18-24 months, would severely disrupt product development and market entry.

While an investor deck names a Chief Product Officer, the more recent due diligence questionnaire clarifies that the CEO currently holds this role, indicating a fluid, founder-centric leadership structure \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 17\], \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. 6\]. The company's plan to hire a Chief Data & AI Officer is a necessary step to begin distributing this concentrated responsibility \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 17\].

### Retention Risk and Mitigation

The company faces substantial retention risk driven by the competitive market for AI talent. AI-native startups operate with smaller teams and pay a 36% median salary premium compared to other startups, placing significant pressure on Novaworks' compensation strategy [Ravio](https://ravio.com/blog/ai-native-startup-hiring). The company's plan to maintain a lean headcount of 53 employees through Year 3 while ARR is projected to grow 134% implies high individual workloads, increasing the risk of attrition \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf, p. 16\].

To mitigate these risks, Novaworks has established a standard equity incentive structure with a 10% option pool reserved post-funding and four-year vesting with a one-year cliff \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 15, 16\]. However, cash and equity compensation must be benchmarked directly against other AI-native firms to remain competitive. Non-financial incentives, such as the compelling mission to serve the deskless workforce and the founders' strong industry reputations, will be critical for attracting and retaining key personnel.

### Succession and Scaling Risk

At this pre-seed stage, Novaworks has no formal succession plan, creating a vulnerability should a key leader depart unexpectedly. The pre-funding departure of a founding team member, Manish Shah, highlights the potential for early-stage team volatility, even though he remains an advisor \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. 7\]. The company's extensive advisory board provides strategic depth but cannot substitute for executive leadership in daily operations \[DOC: Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29*.pdf, p. 18\]. As the company scales, a deliberate strategy for identifying and developing internal talent for leadership roles will be necessary to build organizational resilience.

### Culture and Burnout Risk

The combination of an aggressive roadmap, a lean staffing model, and the founders' plan to defer salaries until January 2026 creates a significant risk of team burnout \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-*Novaworks.pdf, p. 7, 13\]. The "everyone is in Sales" mentality, while fostering an all-hands-on-deck approach, can blur roles and increase pressure if not managed carefully \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-*Novaworks.pdf, p. 26\]. A long-term integration risk also exists; the high-agency, capital-efficient culture that is effective at the startup stage may face challenges integrating into a larger corporate structure following a potential acquisition, which is noted as a possible exit path \[DOC: Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW*-\_Novaworks.pdf, p. 7\].

The table below summarizes the primary talent-related risks and corresponding mitigation strategies.

# Legal and IP

## Overview

Novaworks' legal and intellectual property landscape is defined by its pre-product stage and deep integration with ServiceNow. The venture has a clear plan to develop proprietary IP around its AI-native HCM platform, particularly its "Nova AI Architecture" and "Nova HR Codex." However, significant risks exist. A critical dependency is an unformalized "verbal agreement" to license ServiceNow IP, which includes a grant-back clause that could encumber future developments. Furthermore, the platform's core function—processing sensitive employee data with AI—places it in a high-risk category under emerging regulations like the EU AI Act, creating a substantial future compliance burden that has not yet been fully addressed.

### Key Takeaways

- **Critical Fact 1**: A verbal, non-exclusive license for ServiceNow's "Skills Intelligence" IP includes a grant-back clause, creating a significant unmitigated risk that could encumber the value and exclusivity of Novaworks' own future intellectual property.
- **Critical Fact 2**: The venture's core business in AI-driven Human Capital Management is classified as "high-risk" under emerging global regulations like the EU AI Act, which will impose stringent compliance obligations and significant operational costs.

## Risks

- **IP Encumbrance**: The informal verbal agreement to license ServiceNow IP, which includes a grant-back clause, poses a material risk of limiting the defensibility and commercial value of Novaworks' proprietary technology \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. unknown\].
- **Regulatory Compliance Burden**: As an AI platform for employment, the solution falls into a "high-risk" category under the EU AI Act and faces a complex patchwork of global data privacy laws, creating a significant and costly compliance burden that is not yet fully planned for [Cimplifi](https://www.cimplifi.com/resources/the-updated-state-of-ai-regulations-for-2025/?utm_source=openai).
- **Unsecured IP Ownership**: The company has not yet executed IP assignment agreements with its founders or employees, creating a foundational risk to the ownership and clean title of any intellectual property developed post-funding \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. unknown\].
- **Data Handling Liability**: The platform will process sensitive employee data without a defined data governance, security, or privacy strategy, exposing the venture to significant legal and reputational liability under regulations like GDPR and CCPA [Capstone](https://capstonedc.com/insights/growing-regulatory-risks-for-ai-driven-human-capital-management-platforms/).

## Next Steps

**Additional Evidence**

- **ServiceNow Agreement Draft**: Obtain a draft of the proposed written IP license agreement with ServiceNow to allow for a formal legal review of its terms, particularly the scope of the grant-back provision.

**Derisking Actions**

- **Formalize IP License**: Engage legal counsel to negotiate and formalize the ServiceNow IP license into a written agreement that clearly defines usage rights and minimizes the impact of the grant-back clause.
- **Execute IP Assignments**: Immediately upon funding, draft and execute comprehensive IP assignment agreements with all founders, employees, and contractors to secure ownership of all developed IP.
- **Develop Compliance Roadmap**: Engage specialized legal counsel to create a preliminary roadmap for compliance with key regulations, specifically the EU AI Act and relevant US/EU data privacy laws.
- **Establish Data Governance Policy**: Develop a foundational data governance and privacy policy that outlines the protocols for collecting, storing, and processing sensitive employee data in alignment with major regulatory frameworks.

## Potential Intellectual Property (IP) Considerations

Based on the Novaworks proposal and supporting documents, the company's intellectual property (IP) strategy is centered on developing proprietary AI-native technology while carefully managing potential IP contamination from the founders' current employment.

### Potential for New IP Creation

Novaworks is a pre-product company and has intentionally avoided creating IP to prevent "tainted IP" issues stemming from the founders' association with ServiceNow \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. unknown\]. However, the company has identified several areas where it plans to create defensible IP post-funding. The core of this new IP appears to be in the application of AI to the Human Capital Management (HCM) domain, specifically through its planned AI architecture and proprietary data assets \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=I6mRBPZs85V8JO234MA62nCqiNfjKRkoP1EVIdd%2Fcek%3D), p. unknown\].

Key areas identified for potential IP creation include:

- **Proprietary AI Architecture:** The proposed "Nova AI Architecture" includes several custom-named components such as the "Nova Agent Layer," "Nova SLM" (Small Language Model), "Nova Transformers," and a "Nova Vector DB." The unique integration and orchestration of these elements could be protected as a trade secret \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=I6mRBPZs85V8JO234MA62nCqiNfjKRkoP1EVIdd%2Fcek%3D), p. unknown\].
- **Nova HR Codex:** The company plans to build a "Nova HR Codex for Global Compliance," which appears to be a proprietary knowledge base designed to provide automated compliance capabilities \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. unknown\]. This curated dataset and its application represent a significant potential IP asset. This codex is also central to the venture's compliance strategy, as discussed in the *Potential Future Regulatory or Compliance Considerations* section.
- **Agentic Workflows:** The solution's value proposition is based on "agentic and conversational experiences" that create a "personal assistant" for each employee \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. unknown\]. The specific business methods and processes embedded in these agentic workflows could constitute protectable IP.

### Leveraging Third-Party IP

Novaworks states it is not currently using any externally owned IP \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. unknown\]. However, the company discloses a significant dependency on ServiceNow's technology. Specifically, Novaworks has a "verbal agreement to utilize the Skills Intelligence of ServiceNow through a non-exclusive license" \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. unknown\]. This arrangement includes a critical grant-back clause that "requires sharing of any modifications made to that IP back to ServiceNow," which could encumber future IP development and limit its exclusive value \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. unknown\]. The company also plans to build its AI capabilities using publicly available LLMs and open-source toolkits like Langchain, meaning its IP will lie in the application rather than foundational models \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. unknown\].

### Stated IP Protection Considerations

The company's primary stated consideration is the avoidance of creating IP before the founders fully separate from ServiceNow \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. unknown\]. The provided materials do not detail a formal strategy for protecting future IP (e.g., patent filings vs. trade secret policy).

A key administrative gap exists regarding IP ownership. The company confirms that employees have not yet executed IP assignment agreements, stating this will be done "when our formal employment starts" post-funding \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. unknown\].

### Preliminary Assessment of Potential IP

Novaworks' potential to create valuable IP is centered on its specialized AI applications, proprietary datasets like the "Nova HR Codex," and unique workflow architecture built upon the ServiceNow platform. The founders' awareness of "IP taint" is a positive signal of legal sophistication.

However, two areas warrant significant attention during formal diligence:

1. **ServiceNow IP Agreement:** The verbal, non-exclusive license for ServiceNow's "Skills Intelligence" must be formalized in a written agreement. The scope of the grant-back provision needs to be clearly defined by legal counsel to assess its potential impact on the long-term value and defensibility of Novaworks' own IP.
2. **IP Assignment:** Ensuring all founders, employees, and contractors execute comprehensive IP assignment agreements immediately upon funding is critical to establish a clean chain of title for all newly developed intellectual property.

If the venture progresses, a formal review by IP counsel is essential to formalize the ServiceNow relationship, secure ownership of all created IP, and develop a clear protection strategy.

## Data Usage, Privacy & Third-Party Dependency Considerations

Based on the Novaworks proposal and supporting documents, the venture's operating model presents several considerations regarding data handling and external dependencies that require further diligence.

### Data Usage Profile

The venture's core product is an AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) platform designed to manage the entire employee lifecycle, from hiring to retirement \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. 11\], \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=I6mRBPZs85V8JO234MA62nCqiNfjKRkoP1EVIdd%2Fcek%3D), p. 7\]. This function inherently involves the collection, processing, and storage of sensitive employee personal data and confidential corporate information, such as performance metrics, compensation, and organizational structure. The company's AI architecture diagram also indicates plans to use "Public Data" and "Partner Data" within its data lakehouse, though the specific nature, sourcing, and usage rights for this external data are not detailed \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=I6mRBPZs85V8JO234MA62nCqiNfjKRkoP1EVIdd%2Fcek%3D), p. 10\].

The provided materials do not specify the measures for handling this sensitive data, nor do they outline security protocols or a strategy for compliance with data privacy regulations. Given that AI-driven HCM platforms face increasing regulatory scrutiny over their handling of employee data, this is a notable gap [Capstone](https://capstonedc.com/insights/growing-regulatory-risks-for-ai-driven-human-capital-management-platforms/). Compliance with frameworks such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be critical for market access and risk mitigation [TrustArc](https://trustarc.com/resource/us-consumer-privacy-laws-2025-update/). A more detailed analysis of the evolving regulatory landscape is available in the *Potential Future Regulatory or Compliance Considerations* section.

### Third-Party Dependencies

Novaworks' technical and operational strategy relies heavily on a multi-layered stack of third-party technologies and data.

### Stated Considerations & Consultations

The proposal materials do not explicitly discuss data privacy impact assessments, specific security protocols, or a compliance roadmap for relevant regulations. Furthermore, there is no mention of plans for consultation with internal or external IT Security, Data Governance, or Legal counsel regarding data handling, privacy policies, or the terms of use for third-party software and AI models.

### Preliminary Assessment of Data & Third-Party Considerations

The venture's reliance on sensitive employee data and a complex web of third-party technologies introduces material risks that require formal legal and technical review. The absence of a defined data privacy and security strategy is a critical omission that must be addressed before product development progresses.

Key areas for further diligence include:

- **Third-Party Licenses:** The use of open-source components like Langchain and commercial LLMs necessitates a thorough review of all associated licenses by legal counsel to ensure compatibility with Novaworks' commercial model and to prevent IP contamination or restrictive usage terms [FutureSkillGuides](https://www.futureskillguides.com/ai-regulation-compliance-global-overview-2025/).
- **IP Agreement Formalization:** The "verbal agreement" with ServiceNow for its Skills Intelligence IP must be formalized into a written contract that clearly defines licensing terms, usage rights, and the scope of the share-back provision.
- **Data Governance:** A comprehensive data governance and privacy policy must be developed to address the handling of employee PII and comply with regulations in target markets. This should include conducting a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to mitigate risks associated with processing personal data [TrustArc](https://trustarc.com/resource/us-consumer-privacy-laws-2025-update/).

Early consultation with legal, IT security, and data governance specialists is essential to establish a sound foundation for the company's operations and mitigate potential liabilities.

## Potential Future Regulatory or Compliance Considerations

Based on the Novaworks proposal and its described concept, the venture operates in a domain with significant and evolving regulatory oversight.

### Potential for Future Regulated Application

The venture is an AI-native Human Capital Management (HCM) platform, a sector inherently governed by employment laws and data privacy regulations \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. 1\]. The company's stated market is "Global," which subjects it to international regulatory frameworks \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. 26\]. Furthermore, Novaworks explicitly plans to target highly regulated industries; its capability roadmap includes phased entry into sectors such as healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing \[DOC: [Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29\_.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Novaworks_Presentation_Deck_Colle_Capital_082225.final_29_.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=I6mRBPZs85V8JO234MA62nCqiNfjKRkoP1EVIdd%2Fcek%3D), p. 8\]. The company also notes that a former team member's experience in healthcare will be valuable when it begins to "attack regulated segments" \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. 7\].

### Anticipated Future Regulatory/Compliance Landscape

As an AI-driven platform operating globally in the HCM space, Novaworks will need to navigate a complex, multi-jurisdictional legal landscape. Key future considerations include:

- **Artificial Intelligence Regulation:** The European Union's AI Act, with enforcement beginning in 2026, establishes a risk-based framework for AI systems [Cimplifi](https://www.cimplifi.com/resources/the-updated-state-of-ai-regulations-for-2025/?utm_source=openai). AI used in employment and workforce management, including recruiting, is classified as "high-risk" and subject to strict requirements for risk management, data governance, transparency, and human oversight [Cimplifi](https://www.cimplifi.com/resources/the-updated-state-of-ai-regulations-for-2025/?utm_source=openai). Non-compliance can result in fines of up to 7% of global annual turnover, making this a critical consideration for Novaworks' planned global operations [FutureSkillGuides](https://www.futureskillguides.com/ai-regulation-compliance-global-overview-2025/). In the U.S., there is a growing patchwork of state-level AI laws, and federal agencies like the FTC are applying existing consumer protection laws to address algorithmic bias in hiring and employment [Capstone](https://capstonedc.com/insights/growing-regulatory-risks-for-ai-driven-human-capital-management-platforms/).
- **Data Privacy Laws:** The company will process sensitive employee data, making it subject to numerous data privacy laws. In the U.S., this includes a growing list of state-level regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) [Capstone](https://capstonedc.com/insights/growing-regulatory-risks-for-ai-driven-human-capital-management-platforms/). As of 2025, at least 17 states have enacted such laws, creating a complex compliance environment [trustarc.com](https://trustarc.com/resource/us-consumer-privacy-laws-2025-update/). Global operations would also bring regulations like the GDPR into scope.
- **Industry-Specific Compliance:** Entry into planned vertical markets like healthcare will introduce stringent, industry-specific requirements, such as HIPAA in the United States, which governs the use and protection of health information.

### Stated Awareness & Future Planning

Novaworks demonstrates an awareness of the importance of compliance, listing "automated compliance" as a key product differentiator and planning to build a "Nova HR Codex for Global Compliance" to create a competitive moat \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. 31\]. This codex was also identified as a key potential IP asset in the *Potential Intellectual Property (IP) Considerations* section. However, the provided materials do not specify which regulations this codex will address or detail the strategy for keeping it current with rapidly evolving laws like the EU AI Act.

### Proposed Future Consultation

The venture's documentation does not explicitly mention plans for future consultation with specialized legal or compliance counsel regarding emerging AI and data privacy regulations. The company notes it uses Cooley LLC for general corporate matters but is considering a new firm post-funding \[DOC: [Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW\_-\_Novaworks.pdf](https://zapistorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/organization-project-documents/organization-39/project-2632/Stalwart_Ventures_Diligence_Questionnaire_KSW_-_Novaworks.pdf?sv=2025-07-05&st=2025-11-17T19%3A39%3A29Z&se=2027-11-18T07%3A39%3A29Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=FXgdizRjAxH2mHNChkp9Q5JAze2o50kHBHWaRiT9My0%3D), p. 11\].

### Preliminary Assessment of Future Regulatory Needs

While Novaworks' plan to embed compliance into its product is a positive indicator, its success is contingent on navigating a highly complex and dynamic global regulatory environment. The classification of AI in HR as "high-risk" under the EU AI Act presents a significant future compliance hurdle that will require substantial investment in governance, transparency, and risk management. The lack of a detailed strategy to address specific emerging AI and data privacy laws is a notable gap. Proactive engagement with specialized regulatory counsel will be critical to de-risk the product development roadmap and ensure the "Nova HR Codex" is a defensible asset rather than a potential liability.

## Overall Preliminary Legal/IP Assessment & Key Future Considerations

**Preliminary Assessment of Potential Considerations (Based on Venture Proposal):**

Based on the Novaworks proposal, the concept appears to present opportunities for novel IP creation within AI-driven Human Capital Management and involves the use of sensitive employee data, which will require careful handling. The venture's reliance on third-party IP from ServiceNow under a verbal agreement and its operation in a domain classified as "high-risk" by emerging AI regulations are the most significant immediate considerations.

This assessment is preliminary and based solely on the provided concept information.

**Key Future Legal/IP Consultation Points (If Venture Proceeds):**

If Novaworks progresses beyond this initial concept stage, proactive consultation with relevant internal corporate teams would be advisable on the following:

**Intellectual Property:**

- Formal review by the Corporate IP Team to assess any novel algorithms, software, or processes developed for potential patentability or trade secret protection.

- Guidance on proper documentation and procedures for capturing any new IP generated by the venture team.

- Immediate legal review and formalization of the ServiceNow "Skills Intelligence" license to clarify terms and mitigate risks from the grant-back clause.

**Data Handling & Privacy:**

- Review by the Data Governance Office and/or Legal (Privacy) regarding the proposed collection, storage, and use of employee personal data, ensuring alignment with corporate policies and applicable regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

- Consultation with IT Security on appropriate safeguards for any data processed or stored by the venture's solution.

**Third-Party Components & Agreements:**

- Review by Legal/IP Team of any third-party software licenses (especially open-source components with copyleft provisions like Langchain) or API terms of use to ensure compliance and avoid unintended IP encumbrances.

**Regulatory & Compliance (Future Scope):**

- If the venture explores externalization or expands into heavily regulated internal areas, consultation with Corporate Legal and/or Compliance will be necessary to understand and plan for applicable regulatory requirements, particularly the EU AI Act.

**General:**

- Execution of IP assignment agreements for all founders and employees to ensure a clean chain of title for all created IP.
- Periodic check-ins with the Legal Department as the venture evolves to address any emerging legal or contractual considerations.

**Conclusion & Recommendation for Internal Consultation:**

The Novaworks concept presents several areas where proactive legal and IP guidance will be beneficial if development proceeds. Early and ongoing engagement with the corporation's internal Legal, IP, Data Governance, and Compliance teams, as appropriate for each stage of development, is strongly recommended to ensure the venture aligns with corporate policies, protects corporate assets, and mitigates potential risks.
